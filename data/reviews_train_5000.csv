1596861,an amazing/delightful work!!,"i am now such a maureen dowd fan! this woman is by far one of the best authors i've ever had the pleasure to read. witty, astute, scathing in her assessment of the current non-elected president...not to mention his (or should i say his daddy's?) cronies, the guys who are really calling the shots in washington, dowd has completely captured the essence of ineptitude displayed daily (hour-by-hour? every other minute?) by the man who would-be-but-isn't-really our president.most interesting, i think, is the fact that her writings began well before the mis-election of 2000...providing the reader with a funny/frightening opportunity for hindsight. gosh, if w's mis-guided supporters had only been paying attention earlier, maybe none of us would be in this ""mess"" right now! sigh...not only am i recommending ""bushworld"" to my friends, i am personally sending copies to anyone and everyone i know...merry (early) christmas! don't forget to vote... : )",5,1

83270,enjob so much,"THE GAME - FREE CELL  -Really enjoy the game and so does my husband as he has his own Kindle Fire HD and now, it's not problem for him to stay in the car and me go shopping!!!!!  Yep, that's an answer for my problem!!!",5,1
8432421,"Classic, contemporary romance","What do you call a musician without a girlfriend? A: Homeless. That old joke gets a new twist when the struggling musician is a woman who can't pay the rent and gets tossed into the street by her roommates. Another twist is the novel idea of a handsome young man who has the fortitude and willpower to wait for the wedding night.It doesn't take long for the usual tropes of the romance genre to come into play. Without delivering spoilers, I can only say that the plot has more holes than a golf course, but the narrative is so engaging, most readers won't mind.In spite of my barely willing suspension of disbelief, I kept turning pages (and skimming some too) becauseI actually cared to see how the story played out. And that's a tribute to the author, to be able to tell a predictable story in a way that keeps readers engaged.",4,1
2326474,It Just Works,"Simple things but they work. Think positive thoughts, you'll be creative. Take some down time and your energy factory will be able to handle more output. The positive rituals actually become neuronal connections that soon work automatically for you the same way that the old bad habits used to work against you. Very  similar to a book I read on how to get out of depression called Depression is a Choice. But this is how to be more productive rather than how to get out of depression.",5,1
5677146,Hip hop how it's meant to de done!,"Nas raised the bar so high on Illmatic that he himself couldn't jump over it with his later albums. This captured everything right about hip hop;far from what its detractors said about its glorifying of violence and drugs; the story of a young man and his quest for something better in life than what was handed to him. If you love good music, get this album.",5,1
3333120,Sing you home,Amazing! Another fantastic heart-shredder from Jodi Luckily. Although religious bigotry does not feature on my best seller list I was hooked and could empathise with the characters . Definitely a must read for fans of Jodi.,5,1

4079961,Beautiful book,"More of a time line with illustrations and brief bits of information than a verbose treatment of history. In fact, many important people (Caesar Augustus, Ronald Reagan, The Medici Family, and more...) are barely mentioned or not mentioned at all, to my disappointment. More is said about Hitler than George Washington.Nice reference nonetheless.",4,1
996333,"Typical Lee child story,","Typical Lee child story, third in the sequence of going back to DC, usual twists and turns. If you enjoyed other reacher books, this will satisfy.",4,1
6448853,Very nice.,"Awesome lens for the price. Build quality is very good and pictures come out great. I have this on a crop sensor body, making it 27-64mm. This is my preferred ""walk around"" lens, especially for street photography.",5,1
2811601,Prayer That Avail Much,Good service.  Great book!  I have one and wanted to give it as a gift to a good friend who has only the 1st volume of the book.  I love having all 3 volumes in one.  This is a very useful book for those who want to pray more specifically for concerns you have.  There is no better way to intercede than to pray scripture!,5,1
2385922,Excellent reference!,"This book really brought World War I to life.  I was surprised at how little I really knew about this war.  This may be billed as a kid's book, but people of all ages will enjoy it.  It's a great source for learning a lot about the war in a short period of time.  The entire Eyewitness series is worth checking out.",5,1
3480736,GOOD READ,At first I thought the story was going to be some young love gone bad type of thing. I was so wrong.  This story is very emotional and heart wrenching at times. I had to keep going to see what happens next. Laney and Adrian are tortured souls and yet they find love. It's a good read!,5,1
3071952,Piqued Interest Even More,"Author J.P. Grider has piqued my interest even more now with a jawdropping conclusion to A Touch Of Honor (Book 1 of the Honor Trilogy). This read was off to a great start, with a uniqueness that has room for growth with the following two books. Now I'm left hanging. (Again) Dang, I just keep getting sucked into these trilogys!",4,1

8963236,A designing classic!,"This show, like &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; is truly a classic comedy that deserves to be out on DVD. I love this show. I must be honest, I have yet to purchase this DVD. When I saw it, I went NUTS. Then I saw it was &quot;The Best of&quot;....with only a few episodes. I bit my lip and screamed. Like &quot;Three's Company&quot;, &quot;the best of&quot; just doesn't get it. Especially when I know as soon as I buy it they'll come out with the whole season. I give the show itself 5 stars...it should get ten, but I give the fact it's only a few episodes on DVD...a one. No thanks, as much as I love this show...I'll wait for the first season to be released.",5,1
588681,On the edge of my seat!,"This was my first ""horror"" genre book - I tend to shy away because I don't like horror movies, but the books seem a little more palatable... of course, this book will undoubtedly BE a movie, considering that the author is an award-winning director. The book was written like a movie, and perhaps that is why it was so engrossing. It just cut right to the chase and the action, and it never really died down.Good character development - loved Eph Goodweather and his struggles as a caring father/dedicated doctor, and Satrakian was a little trite but still interesting. Nora wasn't really developed at all... but the cover does say ""Book One"", so there is still time for that!I knew going in that these were not going to be sexy and alluring vampires - but yikes, they were gross! More like zombies than vamps.Cliffhanger at the end, but hey, I knew that was coming!  :)",4,1

506698,One of Lewis' Best,"The Screwtape Letters is a short work of religious fiction by C.S. Lewis originally published in 1942.  Lewis is a well-known mid-twentieth century writer with well-known works in a variety of genres; religious fiction, children's fiction, science fiction as well as religion/philosophy.The Screw Tape Letters consists of a series of letters between a senior demon and his apprentice regarding how to best tempt his human ""patient"".  This setting is used by Lewis to discuss many of the hurdles and sins that humans encounter in day-to-day life.  Lewis has the rare skill of being able to effectively communicate theological ideas in an unassuming manner to the general reader.  From my perspective this is one of Lewis' best pieces of religious fiction (the other being the Great Divorce).  Many of the challenges and failings mentioned in the book continue to resonate with the modern reader.Overall, I highly recommended this short book to all readers.  Those who enjoy this small book may also enjoy The Great Divorce.",4,1
6324919,nice shirt for halloween,I bought this for my son's bat costume.  It worked great.  We sewed felt wings to the shirt and he had it on constantly for most of the month of October.  It washed well and seems to have come through the holiday well.  I can't speak to long term wear as I haven't had it long enough.  The color seems to have lasted through the frequent washes I have given it so far.,5,1

2832854,Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and Sergeant Troy are both less likeable than in the TV series that arose from these books.,"These are the books on which &#34;Midsomer Murders&#34; are based. Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby is a far less likable character in the book, and Troy similarly &#8211; with a chip on his shoulder. However, I like her writing &#8211; it's colourful and original.An old lady sees something unsavoury and shocking (a copulating couple that she recognises) during a walk in the woods &#8211; later that day she is murdered. In true &#34;Midsomer&#34; style there follow 2 more murders, apparently unrelated but of course after many wild goose chases and red herrings, Barnaby with assistance from Troy ties them all up and resolves the case(s).  I particularly enjoyed this one and may very well try another.",4,1

8743875,Classic film,Heart breaking movie; story of a family member not being loved and appreciated for who they are as people rather than for their external accomplishments as defined by the family.  Children should not have to be clones of their parents. Very classic film with excellent acting.,4,1
9302219,"Exciting, with a touch of science.","If you enjoyed the ancient alien series on the history channel, this movie is for you. It is the logical extension of the western chapter of that series. The acting is great with many surprises in the story line. I liked the way that all characters that were in it reflected the way the old west probably ran. Blue ray really helped with the special effects, this is something worth owning, enjoy.",5,1
538862,A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN,"This book was a fascinating journey into the universe of a young girl growing up in a poor family in Brooklyn at the turn of the century (20th). Very simply but well written, the characters are human and real. I'd call it a book about &#34;life&#34;. Fortunately I read it on my kindle so I could easily look up the uncommon words, some of which are from that time period.",5,1

824906,Born a Democrat....,"It is just the right book for me at the right time.  Although it is not this year's campaign,,,,it is still very pertinent and timely.  Mr. G. is concise and succinct....and his droll humor and top notch intelligence shines through.  I especially like the dedication....to the people that run for public office.  I have a daughter on the local city..(small town) council....and it is just so GOOD....I sent the words of the dedication to her....",5,1
717106,"New to quicken, works well","I went to the library and borrowed this book initially, so that I could get started.  As I was going through the chapter, I was taking notes in the borrowed book!! The program did have helpful tips and guided me quickly though the set up, but the book gave some additional help for areas where the program fell short or didn't address.So far, this is a very good program and I would say that if this is your first time using this, get the book.  There are other books similar to this, but when I reviewed them, it almost seemed the exactly the same as the this book (same verbage, pictures, examples??? wassup with that?) Go with the official guide and take good notes!!FYI; I did use Microsoft money in the past, which was probably more user friendly.",4,1

That is until I decided to move out of the room where the router was located - then things went downhill pretty fast. I completely lost the connection before I made it down the hallway to the stairs.

8956571,Worth the Wait,"I thought it was about time they came out with the hulk series on DVD. I hope they put Prometheus and the First, both two-part episodes, they were some of my favorites.I grewup watching the hulk and met Bixby and Ferrigno, at different times, when they were passing through Wyoming. Bixby, I met in 1977-78 after the first 1/2 season of the Hulk, I was only 14-16 years old. He was heading up to Yellowstone Park with his son. He was a great actor, and director, I can seriously say he would never be typecasts from the show. He was very talented, directing episodes of Blossom, Goodnight Beantown, The Woman who loved Elvis and episodes of Mr. Merlin.Ferrigno I met when he was a guest poser in the Mr. Wyoming contest. He was on the comeback trail after being retired from competitive bodybuilding for some 17 years. He weighted in at 310 pounds and looked great for being in his 40s.The Hulk series will always be my favorite, there was never a show like it before on television, or since.",5,1
3516121,Fun Book,"This book was fun to read.  Its interesting to see the world through Donna's eyes. I spent two years in Vietnam during the war as an advisor to the Vietnamese Army and I agree with her about the people, culture and food.  This book is a good read.",5,1

9462240,Great Movie!,"While I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and Forest Whitaker's acting ability, it wasn't quite what I had expected.  I  watched it twice and enjoyed it more the second time around after I had changed my expectations regarding the story line.  I think that it was a good movie particularly once I changed the position from which I was viewing it.",4,1
7320107,Read Spec Before Buying Carefully,"The receiver is powerful and has many connections.  However, I bought this unit for more.  For example:  I would like to use Zone 2.  First of all,  it is very challenging to set up Zone 2 ( and I'm a pretty handy person).  After figuring this out, then I realized you cannot use digital inputs for Zone 2.  Hello!!!  We are almost in 2014!!! No digital inputs can be used?  This means, thru away your fancy and expensive wiring and connections!!  Ok, let's talk about the &#34;Airplay&#34;.  Per the spec noted for this unit on amazon,  the unit has airplay function.  Meaning I can hook up my devices wireless to listen to music I pick (e.g. Pandora, my own music on Iphone or Ipad, etc).  No!! You have to buy another device (a repeater) which may cost up to $100. And Yamaha carefully did not clearly explain this.  I have contacted Yamaha and complained, more than once.  And I got &#34;canned emails&#34; back.  Funny that this unit is not that cheap!  I wonder how Yamaha handles complains for units at low cost!!!",1,0

5201638,Inspiring story,"&#8220;The Master's Plan&#8221; by Stephanie Tully is an inspiring story about marriage, politics, purpose and faith. Selena Jones, second wife to Pastor Woodruff, becomes convinced that God has a mission for her on earth and &#8211; all inspired &#8211; goes about to realise her goal.Things do not go smoothly with the Commissioner who promised to help her and with the church committee. It gets worse when her husband suddenly miraculously disappears.In this inspiring tale, whose central message of faith is relevant also to non-Christians, hope, integrity, goodness and perseverance prevail.The characters are not holier than thou but real people with real problems who aspire to solve their struggles the best they can.A book about choices we make, temptation and belief. Told with sharp observations about human nature and behaviour, wit and humour and with a caring and warm tone this should appeal to many.",5,1
5761057,If you try sometimes you might find you get what you need.,"This album marked a return to The Rolling Stones R&B; roots, after the (disappointing) psycedelic albumTheir Satanic Majesties Request.  This is a classic album, from ""Sympathy For the Devil"" to ""Salt of the Earth"".  It features my favorite Stones song, ""Street Fighting Man"", which was NOT a hit single, because it was banned by most radio stations.  Just buy it already!",5,1
7913743,Aesthetically  Pleasing and Shapely,"If you have a nose like Cyrano De Bergerac, Jimmy Durante, or Bill Clinton you may have some difficulty negotiating the 1.5&#34; opening of this beautiful whisky glass. It's shaped to optimize sniffing and enjoyment of whisky.  Those to whom I showed these glasses offered suggestions of using the glasses for brandy or even some wine sampling.With their exquisite shape the glasses are very attractive and make a great presentation for guests. The base is nicely weighted, balancing the glass nicely, so that it would take quite a jostle to tip the filled glass over.We like that the Bellemain glasses are dishwasher safe and that they can also be used for desserts like parfaits or things so decadent you want to limit the amount consumed.Sample provided by the seller.",4,1
9161670,Compelling and Provocative,"This is one of the better ""coming out"" movies in that it is easy to identify with the feelings, the complications, and the misunderstandings a guy can experience when he begins to seriously and honestly consider his orientation.  It deals with the issues tenderly and yet honestly.  The physical connections are engaging and true to life.  It is set around lovely beach settings also!If the viewer is considering his orientation and questioning the possible joys and consequences thereof, this should be added to his must-have's.",4,1
1423733,Memorable Characters,"Another fabulous, unforgettable novel by Anne Tyler, who never disappoints me.  As in most of her books, the main characters are very real and flawed and life doesn't go quite as planned.  But because they have good hearts, things turn out all right in the end.  Her themes often revolve around the choices people make, as does this novel.  I couldn't put down ""A Patchwork Planet"" and read the entire thing in a day and a half.  Now I'm recommending it to my book club.  Perhaps my favorite Anne Tyler so far.",5,1

5972326,Great set from legendary band.,"This is a great set from a legendary band.  I would recommend this DVD to any New Order fan.  For ages, they have been one of the most consistent outfits in modern rock.  Every release, be it a video or CD, is always top notch.  One other thing though... I find it hard that someone like the reviewer below would be a ""die-hard"" fan of Joy Division, but never knew that New Order was the name the band chose when they decided to carry on without Ian Curtis.  That just really sounds downright silly.  No ""die-hard"" fan would have missed that bit of information.  A casual fan that proclaims to be die-hard...well, maybe.",4,1

I searched Amazon and picked four of the highly rated books to send her hoping at least one would be helpful to her.  She enjoyed them all, but called me especially thanking me for this one.  She said that, out of all the books, this one was the most practical, helpful book.  She said it made her feel that her feelings were ""normally abnormal"" - meaning that they were very normal feelings for an abnormal, unplanned situation - she said it helped her feel that the immense emotions associated with her loss were not hers alone but were ""normal"" for such a very difficult situation and that others had survived the grieving process.  I told her I would put her thoughts here so others who want to reach out to a friend in a similar situation would feel comfortable purchasing this book.  God bless all who have lost their dear companions.  Our prayers and thoughts reach out to you.",5,1
467089,More style than substance,I have to disagree with most of the reviewers on this page. I've long been an Elmore Leonard fan and appreciate his lean writing style and clever plotting. But it seems to me that with his last couple of novels he's been leaning heavily on his style and shorting us on substance. All flash but not much you can sink your teeth into. Compare this novel with his earlier stuff and it comes up sadly lacking. I hope he gets back to form with his next book.,2,0
2236061,We read this over and over,Our (almost) 2 year old loves this book.  He asks to read it over and over every night.  It is a small book so he likes to hold it himself.

Realism is fine and it does have some redemptive value to be sure as well as spotlight certain issues, but again I found this one to be too depressing and just too ""dark.""  I have probably read almost all Kingsbury's novels.  I like them and I recommend them, but probably not THIS one.",2,0

Watching this film on cable yesterday, the movie doesn't once fall into the campy column.  I can't say the same for the rest of the series.  To tell you the truth I think that they should have stopped at the one movie.  But still, this movie has everything, laughs, lite-suspense, and just an all around good, clean family fun.",5,1

While it is not a &#34;full blown&#34; novel, Jack and Hope while young, embrace that &#34;sends your heart a fluttering&#34; feeling that love can do to you!

Everything about it was superbly done--the author was very familiar with France's landscapes, cuisine and culture.

3821121,needs better editing,"While I really liked the story and characters, I found the constant misuse of verb tenses (heed instead of heeded for example) and other errors annoying. I can understand these being missed a couple of times, but it was all through the book. I also didn't like the way the author would stop in mid-sentence to give the English word for things like &#34;fash or ken&#34;. Most people who read this type of novel already know what those words mean and really if you want to do that, please don't keep doing it for the same words over and over.I would have given this a 5 star rating if not for the things mentioned above.

The heroine is very silly and imprudent in behavior and the hero did not particularly appeal to me either.  Seems to me pretending to be dead because your face has been disfigured in an accident shows a very superficial character.Setting the time period in the 1800s did this book no favor either because nothing and no one in it seemed to fit the era.  I had just finished reading Anna Campbell'sSeven Nights in a Rogue's Bed (Sons of Sin), which also has a Beauty and the Beast theme, before picking up this book by Montgomery.

Lovely characters and quirky locals -  I hope she continues to revisit Blue Moon junction.  It was great to see Loch and Ginger again and I hope we see the birth at some stage in the future!  I got a bit confused with the Hooperation references - was this supposed to be cooperation?  And Downton Abby maybe Abbey?  But didnt detract from the book.  My only complaint was it finished too soon - I would have liked to have some chapters on how she got on living in such a big family!  The children were so cute...  Please keep revisiting Blue Moon Junction Ms St Clair!,5,1

Before each video there is introduction and commentary by the Hollies  mostly Allan Clark and Graham Nash  and is all VERY interesting.The quality of the videos is Pretty damn good considering the years and the songs still sound wonderfully Vibrant and Fresh.It's very cool to finally see the guys singing their songs as they looked back then  and then to see them NOW  Allan Clark always had one of the best RnR voices EVER  and Hollies harmony cannot be missed  you know it it sec you hear it.  The Hollies ROCK  Then and Now and ALWAYS  must own collection for any music fan.Wish the Company who did this would Do a Collection by the other BEST group of the 60's  THE SEARCHERS,5,1

As another amazon member stated, you should not use balls for guinea pigs because their spines are not that flexible, and a guinea pig should have at least 7.5 square feet in a cage, but besides this, the information is correct and very detailed.

Diana can come off as too amazing until you think about who she really is.  She's supposed to be perfect.  Literally.  The villains she faces here are great and in great numbers.  The one drawback to this book is that vast number of characters are sometimes overwhelming.  The art, mainly by Drew Johnson, is fantastic and underrated.  Added to that are truly gorgeous covers by J.G. Jones.  Overall, a great read that should be considered among some of the best Wonder Woman stories.",4,1

As always, Nia Forrester did a fabulous job - You have romance, a good plot and steamy sex scenes. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because Keisha's and Marcus relationship kind of confused me. She was naive when it came to Marcus' true intentions...but then again she wanted him just as much as he wanted her but supposedly, she's madly in love with Jayson.

But anyway, this movie is great.By the other hand, the spanish dub is from SPAIN, it's awful to hear a movie with that accent, they should've used the Latin American dub, because in Spain they use PAL, so, they'll never buy this DVD. It's a waste of dub, when are they going to understand we Latin Americans can't stand spanish dubs from SPAIN.... THe DVD lacks of Spanish subtitles too....",4,1

In fact, through this training program, I have lifted my PR on a 5k from 36:17 (a time I ran twice) to 28:56, hitting my goal of a 5k in under 30 minutes. So far so good with the Galloway.

The Tenth Anniversary Concert, as seen on PBS, included a special encore presenting actors who played Jean Valjean in productions from 17 different countries, each stepping up to sing a line, or two, of ""Do You Here the People Sing"" in his own language.

It focuses on the first three wives (with Anne as the centerpiece) but Catherine of Aragon plays a sizeable role in this film, and Jane Seymour appears later on.The actress for Anne did a nice job with the role and the story itself is fairly well-written. The costumes and backgrounds are visually pleasing, and while this story has a few historical inaccuracies, it is definitely a lot more accurate than the 1933 film. My favorite scene is near the end where Anne gets all fired up and vows that her daughter will be a good ruler (and it did come true) The dynamics between the actor and actress who played Henry and Anne worked out quite well for this film.",4,1

I love the dark moodiness of ""Since You Went Away"" and plaintive ""Night Without Sleep"", but the standout track is the closer ""Don't Look Now"". BLISTERING wah-wah guitar and an instantly infectious melody. An absolutely KILLER track. Should be in heavy rotation on every AOR and classic rock station. Smithereens fans and power-pop afficionados will eat this up, and those who might be new to Pat's music won't be disappointed. Guaranteed.",5,1
500008,It is terrific,"You might not have thought about Magellan much (...) but this is a great adventure story.Some of the grand subjects for biographers weren't always the nicest human beings. This fact is part of the tension in ""Over the Edge."" Bergreen can't decide whether Magellan should be more scorned for his ill treatment of the crew or admired for the greatness of his navigation and ballsy achievement.The book reads more like a contemporary magazine story than your standard turgid historical work, as if Bergreen was writing about something 30 years ago instead of hundreds of years ago. It feels fresh. And it's got enough plot elements to keep anyone happy, even if you have no interest in navigation or exploration -- political intrigue,(...), travelogue.",4,1
8819276,Better than the Original,"Although the presentation is not as stylish as the original, I prefer this version.

Got me to go back and look at old authors like Theodore Stugeon and all that ilk.can't recommended this highly enough.  Its great sci-fi that has been lacking, to my knowledge, in this genre.  I, personally, dont count the dragons and sword old mythology as sci fi anymore. But this certainly is.His 'aliens' are somewhat amusing and the whole premise is a nice twist!

I happened to read the Assassin series the last, and I have to say what a way to complete Blake reading spree.King of Swords, in my humble opinion, is the best work by Mr. Blake so far. It's a lot darker than any of his other works - and for this reason, it's not my favorite book by him. See, I don't like dark grim tales in general. They make me depressed... more. But how beautifully and richly dark it is! Like a kind of rich dark chocolate. It's the perfect analogy for me. I don't like chocolate. But I do and can appreciate a great piece of dark chocolate, a very rare occasion. King of Swords is one of those phenomenal rarities. What a treat.",5,1

822190,Deeply moving and unforgettable,"There is a lyricism and rhythm to Sebastian Barry's writing that is so beautiful, it takes your breath away.  In the case of ""A Long, Long Way"" which is about a young man's experiences of the horrors of trench warfare in WWI, Barry's telling of the story does nothing to diminish the brutality of this war and everything to humanise the young soldiers who were sent to fight it.  Willie Dunne, just turned 18, is like young men everywhere.  It so happens that his transition from boy to man takes places in one of the most ghastly settings of modern time.  This is his life and Barry gives us his perspective in the most powerful and moving way.  He also gives us new eyes to see and weep for Willie Dunne and the millions of others like him whose sacrifice is recorded on the cold war memorials around the world.",5,1
8849606,Snore Fest,"I saw this film a while ago, and still have nothing good to say about it.  I almost didn't bother even watching the whole thing, it had me yawning.  The music is repetitive and annoying.  The focus was on the character's downward spiral thanks to drug use, and didn't accomplish portraying the tragedy that is the death of dreams well at all. The characters failed to move me.  It seemed to me they never had anything going for them to begin with, and thus not really anything to lose.  It just seems like a film you'd show someone to scare them away from drug use.",1,0

945450,Partly True,"There are a few main ideas that are very useful in this book. The 80/20 principle has a lot of truth to it. Doing 2 or 3 most important things per day has really helped me. Hiring out work when possible, and sticking to your very best contacts and clients (part of the 80/20 thing) seems like it can really help us with our business. These are worth a quick read of the book.On the other hand, much of what the author presents is personal experience from the perspective of getting what you want out of life. He is free to choose that life-style, of course, but these ideas are so much more powerful and even fulfilling for the individual, when applied to creating a life-style where we have time to serve, build solid relationships, and become great people.",4,1
3882331,Soooooo Mad!!!!!,"This book started off wonderfully for me! It was a cute love story between two best friends and I really liked that concept. Then they have to go off to separate colleges and they agree to start fresh and not be girlfriend /boyfriend.  This was okay but when Laney started to get mad at Evan for certain things and she basically was being a hypocrite that's when the book went downhill. Laney meets a new guy.... Dane:( and is instantly &#34;comfortable&#34; with him (something that has never happened before). I really didn't mind the love triangle but this author made Laney out to be kind of whorish who played with two guys emotions. Yes she did feel remorse but if you really love someone then you don't get involved with anyone else, because that person would be consuming your every thought. Okay writing but the plot made me give this book 2 stars.",2,0

1905173,Loved the inside story.,"Bill Carter does what very few authors nowadays do: he breaks out words that I am forced to look up. For that reason alone, I love his work.By all accounts, this is a book that had no right to be written. If you stop to think about it, NBC's stated motive for going about the transfer of The Tonight Show as they did in 2004/2009 was to prevent a repeat of 1993. It didn't quite work out that way, and that's funny in and of itself, as is NBC's continued inability to get out of its own way. Alternatively sad, funny, and historical treatise on certain people and things in television, Carter turns in another gem about the late night battlefield. Can't recommend highly enough.",5,1

Landscape shots make it so.I waited until I got this DVD, keep watching for it to come out.Great script.  Cast perfect except for Cage.  I am NOT a fan of his.I remember years ago that Olympia had her Oscar stolen.  She deserved it.  Cher did as well along with the script.1 thing I do NOT like about this edition of the film.

This is a good action filled story but the on again off again of the romance was a smidge tiresome.

There are several books in this series and the only problem I had was getting them in the right order. But I really enjoyed reading about this family, and the love they had for one another.

Finally, Batman has been made the way it should have been.  Batman Begins puts Batman into the real world, while at the same time perfectly capturing the mystique of the comic.  Congratulations Christopher Nolan.  First the casting of Christian Bale was right on.  I've seen Bale in many pictures from Shakespeare to psycho, so I was confident he would do a good job, but he did better than expected.  He captured the duality of Bruce Wayne/Batman perfectly.  The rage that shows on his face is at times totally intense, but he easily plays the fop (the scene where he pretends to be drunk is fantastic).  This movie dazzles in its simplicity.  The story is strong,the special affects are not overdone and the acting is perfect.  Plus it sets up perfectly for a sequal.  Well done all involved.",5,1

However, any mature gay man must be insulted by this cliche-ridden piece of fluff.

8415922,If You Read One Book This Year...,"Read this one.There are very few books that make me emotional. Reading about Dally&#8217;s life and his viewpoint of the world is an eye opener for even the most hardened souls. I don&#8217;t think I can describe, in words, what I feel after reading the end of this book.The reader meets a man named Dally with a life that is harder than most could imagine. His thought patterns and his emotional reactions were alien to me, but at the same time I could feel for him. It was, at times, frustrating to see how other characters reacted to him in the book, and I know that it made me a more understanding person.I think the book should come with a warning that it&#8217;ll make you stop and think about your own life. It will make you wonder what it is that others are thinking around you, and how they view the world. This is honestly one of the best books I&#8217;ve read in my lifetime, and I hope to see more from this author.",5,1

There are too many shades of gray and even a couple of color thrown in for good measure.The book is entertaining, have a couple of surprises and twists, leaves you guessing until the last page and is generally worth it.I especially liked the afterword, which reflects the current division in American politics: you are either extreme right, extreme left or a fool (the words most used for the third group cannot be published...).

It still has the typical dark Wumpscut mood to it but as a whole the work is slower and perhaps less confrontational and unlike what is stated in one of the reviews below, it isn't close minded to be aware that there are some &quot;mainstream&quot; undertones to the songs. However, this is by no means a mainstream work at all. It's perhaps just a more mellow cd than previous works (if you can call anything by Wumpscut &quot;mellow&quot;). I just fear that this may be the sign of things to come in the future. I hope not, I would hate to see those undertones become overtones on the next release.

5012580,very unique,I know it takes courage for Christian authors to obediently write books that would broach normally taboo subjects within the church and this author has done just that.At first I myself was taken back at the brash words the author used to describe prostitutes but I realized that it's because we've adapted ourselves to the political correctness words of this world and during the era this book is about those words were common.The characters were well developed and the characterization of God's forgiveness and restoring abilities were perfectly illustrated but I did feel like in a couple of areas there were subjects started or people talked about  with no final conclusion or mention of them again.All this to say it was a wonderful book and more like them should be written,5,1

4198785,A great book for non-denominationalism,"This book was great in the highest sense of great.  A great book is one that has thoughtful material as well as it being well written.  This book is both.  It talks about the push to decentralize organizations and the beauty or influence that these organizations are able to have.  It is a great defense for the church being non-denominational.  Personally, I saw a lot of parallels to non-denominationalism in the book.  It is not a church book, but speaks loudly to a church world.  That the church should be a organization that is more like the starfish than the spider.  In fact, you see the first century church functioning like the organizations that are highlighted.  I highly recommend this book, one of the best books of the year for me.",5,1

But when the credits start rolling and you  start doing whatever you're doing it grips you because this film makes you think! (which is a sign of a great movie!) What I like about the movie is it goes straight to the point no scene is in this movie as a filler, and all the actors don't seem to be acting they just simply are (what they're playing!) And the scene that touched me the most is where the Colombian hostess (who offered Maria shelter in her time of need)is explaining how one gets homesick in the U.S. but when one gets to send money back home after receiving one's first paycheck (how it affects you as the provider of the family) that just rips your heart right out.but because the acting is nuanced you have to pay attention to know where she is coming from!

We meet the recipient of the hair at the end. I'm not certain if it could have been done with this age group, but carrying a parallel story with both the girl needing hair and Sophie having too much hair might have made this a deeper story and might have inspired more people to consider locks of love and locks for kids.A nice story, but leaves my granddaughter with questions for me like, ""Why doesn't the little girl have hair?""",4,1

A Lambert who is trying to figure out just who has targeted Nighshade.Max gets a warning out to Syd and she and the other wives are rescued.So begins one great read.This one has a mine in Africa, Max's half brother, the Kid, Senator Vaugn, Kacie, Griff and Kacie rescuing Aladdin and Canyon and everyone trying to figure out just who has targeted them and for what reason.Another great read by Kendig and I sure hope she isn't stopping the series with Firethorn.Good God. She's got Aladdin, Diegh and quite a few others to go forward with.Five Stars.",5,1
6470437,"Excellent in Daytime, Flash is underpowered","This camera takes awesome pictures in the daytime. However, at night in my home, I saw poor performance from the flash particularly when you zoom in.  I had multiple shots that were too dark or blurry even some when the subject was about 6 feet away.  It was kind of hit or miss if the shot was awesome using the flash.  These bad shots occured with two regular lamps on in the evening. I just wish Kodak would have beefed up the flash and added a light assist for focusing.  If so, this would have been my favorite.  The movie mode is excellent.I decided to return it and get a cannon A85.  This kodak camera lacks picbridge, manual focus, white balance in auto, beam focus assist for low light focusing, memory is on bottom (bad for tripod shooting), must use kodak lithium ion battery (cannon uses AA's).  The cannon flash is much better than the kodak and I am more satified.  The video mode on the 7440 is superior to the A85, but for pictures, the A85 rocks.Giving it 4 stars in generous, should have been 3.",4,1
1810778,A really good read,"I loved the first book because it was something a little bit different (and yet still fitting into the vampire/werewolf mythology) from the other paranormals that I've read. I like Kitty because she's both strong and weak at the same time - which is a lot more real, more human, than these paranormal characters are sometimes. So I was really looking forward to the sequel. Good news! The sequel does not disappoint. More of what I loved about the first book (though she wasn't on the radio as much, so I missed that a little), new characters introduced (Luis!), and Kitty being forced to become more public than she already was. Lots of action, character development, a little sex - all in all it was a great book. This is definitely a series that I'll be buying new as soon as each book comes out. I'm so happy that there will be at least two more Kitty adventures. I look forward to seeing where Kitty goes next.",4,1

3453205,"FUN, and funny","This is a great little mystery with high hilarity.  Yes, there are a number of improbable scenes, a couple that are Impossible-Over-The-Top, but it's all in good fun and keeps the pages turning. It was nice to read about a 45 year-old-heroine who had a lot of life and love left in her, with perhaps too great a sense of adventure and not enough sense to stay out of trouble.  Karen Cantwell takes soccer mom to a whole new level.  I really enjoyed the romantic aspects of this novel; they fit in seamlessly and were as much a mystery as the mystery!  If you need an escape or a great beach read, this might very well be it.  Highly recommended!",5,1

The accounts, written by Harvard students and professors, will greatly encourage those who have struggled with their faith on the intellectual level (as opposed to the social and/or physical level for which countless books have been written, i.e., suffering).  The accounts are extremely well-written and often profound (after all, these are Harvard students and professors).

7902259,"sturdy, functional, a great lunch companion!",I really like this lunch set.  I have used it for baby carrots and apple slices with almond butter in the little sauce container.  It worked great!  a perfect size for my serviing portions!  I have also used it without the divider to hold fresh salad and put the dressing in the sauce container.  The seals on these is wonderful and never once worried about salad dressing leaking out into my lunch bag (as has happened in the past.  You know the lid is on right when it snaps into place. The extra rubber ring makes a tight seal and then the outer red ring on the lid keeps it firmly snapped into place.the one think I wish it had was an extra lid for the interior divider piece so you could use that as a third container if desired (rather than just nesting it inside the one rectangular container).  still I really like this set and think I'll get some more of these.  This was my first set of OXO containers and won't be my last.  Good quality and very functional!,5,1

This is a must read.",5,1
8439605,Feel the Heat!,"HEAT is definitely a way to describe these our main characters in this story.  From the moment they meet, they are pulled together by a sexual heat that cannot be denied.Zoe has come to meet with Dominick seeking his permission to refurbish a resort that is on his property on the island of Ancora.  He is Prince in name only, but contracts were signed nearly 30 years ago by his grandfather, giving him final approval to preserve the ecology of the island.Zoe and Dom are both independent, self-sufficient and definitely hard headed.  From the very beginning, the banter between them is full of innuendo and all out battle. There are no filters here to dilute their intentions.  It is this basic honesty that also draws them together with their &#34; no bulls**t attitude.This book ended up being very entertaining.  What more can you ask for besides a drop dead gorgeous prince, an exotic island, hot sexy love scenes, and an intrepid heroine?",4,1

I closed the book and vowed not to read another page. I have nothing but pure love for Urban stories but at least have the story line connect with our urban  lifestyle. This was just to far fetch! Here you have Precious who is a virgin she using her neighbor Jamal to practice sex on and she masters it to the tee. Now she uses it the same way her drug addicted mom did but with class.

It is a very good movie and I highly recommend this movie to others who like drama dialog driven movies.  This isn't the normal fluff you expect from Rob Reiner.  Pfiffer and Wilis were very good and had good chemistry in both hating and loving each other.

8922791,"Funnier than American Beauty, and more believable.","This movie is a scream. The comic timing is almost perfect. The humor is close to the pain, and that's what propels this movie forward from incident to incident in Enid's life.As she almost leaves high school, Enid is her own person, filled with bravado and vulnerability. She's wandering around, tragically unsure of where she wants to go and how to get there.I've met Enid several times in my life. Maybe that is why I became so fond of her in this movie, why I had such high hopes for her, and why I didn't want the movie to end. For that matter, all of the characters in this movie are familiar and sometimes all too real.Both Ghost World and American Beauty involve the collision between a middle aged man and a young woman, but otherwise have little in common. American Beauty started with an almost realistic portrayal of a man in a midlife crisis, and ended up as a wad of cartoon cookie dough. Ghost World began life as a comic book portrayal of a young lost soul, and resulted in a movie that is creme brulee.",5,1

I have to confess, I found it a little too ""Vertigo""-y for me, like DC's fabled trip-out-the-reader imprint, which I sort of outgrew a while back. Not really into Bermejo's purposefully grotesque artwork, either, but overall I suppose this book was okay. Obviously, the intent was to capitalize on the Heath Ledger/Dark Knight movie interpretation of the character as a crazy guy wearing smeary make-up (as opposed to the original Joker, whose face and flesh were disfigured in a chemical accident...) and for fans of that version, this book will have a big payoff. Gnarly, mean, disturbing version of Bats, as well. (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain book reviews)",4,1

6040015,Why this octogenarian purchased the Essential Glenn Miller,"I am a long-time fan (at 83 years young) of the swing bands that I grew up hearing.  As a budding trombonist I also favored Tommy Dorsey and Jack Teagarden, and others.  The music of Glenn Miller however became the music of our &#34;greatest generation&#34;, those who fought for our freedom in World War 2.  His untimely death while enroute to a USO appearance was a shock to all of us.  The quality of the recordings is excellent and the set is a very good anthology of his band's many hits.  I would recommend it to anyone in my age group to stir up memories of our youth, and to music historians looking for a representative sample of why swing became so popular in the '30s and '40,",5,1

The parts about their new restaurant adventure are fine, but the real intriguing pages of the book have to do with the actual genocide that occured in 1994.The author finding out that one of his new restaurant workers killed some of his neighbors is riveting.  Readers will also find out that Rwanda is the most crowded country in Africa, and it's nickname is &#34;Land of 1000 Hills.&#34;The book deals with the history of Rwanda's Belgian colonization, and how Rwanda and Africa itself continue to transform themselves.A good read and well worth the effort.

3939118,Loved this collection,"I loved this book. I've often been disappointed by short stories, but this collection rocked. Annalisa Crawford creates scenes that draw you right in. It's like she says to herself, &#34;I wonder what it would be like to be ....&#34; and then finishes these sentences: A woman getting (or making) nuisance phone calls; A person in a relationship waking up with someone other than their partner; a husband and wife still holding hope that their long-missing daughter might return to them ... alive. And more. She takes us into these people's lives, with vivid description that create scenes so visually and emotionally real. And best of all, she surprised me Every. Single. Time. Crawford has a dark side and a funny side and an emotional side and a compassionate side and all these come through in this collection. It's awesome.",5,1

Though the slimy Chemical owner & Cromwell tried to buy the land to put a Chemical plant, they never failed in doing so.

Leigh Brackett's John Eric Stark is the next generation, and Han Solo is a long way down the road. (Note also this is where the song and title &#34;Green Hills of Earth&#34; originate.) The book is a collection of all the short stories, mostly published in the 1930's, and would benefit from being read one at a time between other stories. Otherwise the pattern of Smith, hard up for work, getting in well over his head, and frequently needing to be rescued becomes a little obvious. But if you're a classic SF junkie, the settings alone are worth the price.",4,1

Knowing I would get my hands on a great story, I feared the expected turn-off to the main characters as had happened in the first two novels. It was that, ""you hate it so much you have to read it"" kind of feeling. But an all new cast is presented in this novel bringing with them a fresh start and a new story; and the possibility for many new and exciting stories to come.  Alan F. Troop is a good writer. His novels are filled with excitement and action. It is the quick and easy-reading entertainment that draws me to the Delasangre books, not the love of the characters...which can be somewhat refreshing, I think.  Take a break from those heavy tear-jerkers, and the books that leave you speechless and dumbfounded. Give these books a chance, they are very fun!",5,1
8725197,"Very Good, But Why Was it Fictionalized?","An excellent film that follows, yet also fictionalizes, the 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial, reportedly to attack McCarthyism's impact on intellectual discourse. The changes' link to McCarthyism are imperceptible, and undermine its credibility. Instead of attorneys William Jennings Bryan and Charles Darrow (funded by the ACLU), we get Matthew Brady (also a 3-time presidential candidate) and Henry Drummond (funded by the Baltimore Herald). Other added distractions include a fictional preacher's daughter, engaged to the high-school teacher on trial and thereby estranged from her rabble-rousing father, and townspeople supposedly antagonistic to those who came to town for the trial. Nonetheless, the film is especially moving because the underlying attitudes portrayed from 1925 remain alive and well today.",4,1

4247238,Book 2 - Awesome.  Was pulled in from the very beginning.,"I discovered Kathy Fuller with the first book in this series.  This story was about Anna learning to trust and love again after a devasting breakup.  Her story was different from other amish stories in that we learned about her health issues that may prevent her from having children and the learning to believe in herself and her new found love in Lukas.  I am very interested to see how her relationship plays out in the coming books regarding this issue.  The other story that was woven through Anna's is the story of Aaron and Elizabeth.  Aaron ran into difficulty as he was growing, landed on the wrong side of the tracks.  We learn about what he has done to change his ways, we are witnessing the love growing between him and Elizabeth.  Overall, a great story and I throughorly enjoyed it.  Weould recommend to anyone.

She becomes a minor vigilante in her crusade against drug dealers. Not killing them but just making their lives a bit inconvenient. Problem is that still draws their attention to her. But she has also drawn the attention of DPD, especially Hank and Eddie, and the rest of the Hot Bunch by getting into a gun battle right in front of Fortnum's, and they are determined to shut her down.Vance has made it his personal mission to shut her activities down. Jules just wants the drug dealers to leave her kids at the shelter and on the street alone and as usual Tex is a go on increasing the level of insanity.Probably my third favorite book in the series. A new secondary character emerges in the form of May, one of Jules' friends from the kids shelter she runs.",5,1

After arriving, they start getting warnings to stay away, some subtle, some not so subtle.  There's not much more I can add without giving away some good bits of the story so pick up a copy and read it!This was a very interesting book.  Before this, I had never heard of an Aswang which is similar to a vampire in Filipino folklore.  I would have loved to have had more of the history of an Aswang in the book so I could understand it better since it isn't something I've heard of before but there is a small section at the end of the book that explains it.

Compared to my previous mp3 player, it's a little warmer which is desirable because my headphone(KSC75) is a little bright sounding. But, its volume is on the weak side. With KSC75, it's on about 80-90 percent of the maximum volume all the time. KSC75 is not very efficient with its 60 ohm impedence compared to other portable headphones, but if you are using high impedence headphones, you might want to look eleswhere. You may add a headphone amp to boost the volume, but it defeats the purpose of this very portable player. Otherwise, it's an excellent mp3 player.",4,1

As an avid reader of Ashley Antoinette , I was not surprised that she was able to pen this novel without losing any of her characters or confusing her readers by doing too much. As always, she did just enough to take us into the lives of the  main characters of The Prada Plan and she let us know that she isn't finished and there is more to come. Very good job.",4,1

The plot has a good time line and it's characters are once again - rich, rich, rich.

Second, I am not reviewing this Dream Theater album as much as I am commenting on the SHM import version from Japan. I have this fetish for remasterings and figure 'people will do better than the original' - so I coughed up the money for this Japanese SHM-CD (and others as to save on shipping). It appears that all they did was to increase the levels on the whole album! Also, this has created a terrible boomy lower midrange while the originals have a tight and punchy sound.I have an audiophile system and can tell you that there is no improvement on the originals. In fact, the originals are textured and nuanced compared to these terrible SHM monstrosities. Save your money and get the domestic releases - they are perfect!!!",2,0

2894711,A guideline to making permanent changes in one's lifestyle,"Registered dietitian and motivational specialist Jill Fleming presents Thin People Don't Clean Their Plates: Simple Lifestyle Choices For Permanent Weight Loss is not a get-thin-quick fix, or a fad diet, but rather a straightforward guideline to making permanent changes in one's lifestyle and one's body. Restrictive diets don't work as a long-term weight-loss solution, because they cause the body to enter a fasting mode that burns fewer calories. What does work long term is balanced nutrition instead of just cutting out foods, a lifelong commitment to exercise - even simple exercises that can be done while driving a car - and a sincere commitment to treating one's physical body better overall. Highly recommended for anyone striving to make positive improvements in their weight management and overall physical health.",5,1

I am an independant, wish i could vote for either party, i say this because especially bad are democrats who seem out to attack ""real"" Christians...recent examples are laws passed to force Catholic charities and hospitals to offer (forcibly pay for) birth control, abortion, and homosexual adoptions, all against our faith.  Wake up, the day is coming when it will be illegal for pastors to preach against homosexuality or other things the liberals dont like , just like a few countries in Europe and Australia (A pastor recently went to jail for reading the Bible in church, reading from the passages that talk about homosexuality).

5666695,"Toto, I found you","This is a good example of an album where the second side is better than the first.  Even though ""Rosanna"" is a great song, the rest of the music on side one sounds exactly the same.  The songwriting for each song on side one is so similar to each other, it's not even funny.  Of course, it's melodic and enjoyable, so I'm not really complaining.Side two opens with a burning rubber guitar riff rocker, and following that is an almost Electric Light Orchesta-like pop song.  There's another song on the second side that sounds like something Stevie Wonder would do (""Waiting for Your Love"") and of course, I don't even NEED to mention the song that closes the album.  It's the song that introduced me, and I'm sure thousands of other people, to the band (no, it wasn't ""Hold the Line""- nice try, though!)Well, side two is the clear winner for me.  How many times did a band save their better material for the second half of an album?  Doesn't happen often!",4,1

You follow along with Vin as she learns about her powers and the powers of those around her. This series has such an interesting and well thought out magic system with believable limits, not too weak, not too powerful. The world seems so real, the characters are all well written.The payoffs as the author answers some of the mysteries about this world are great, but often he just gives you more questions to be answered later. Just when you think you have things figured out and you know how it's all going to end, it turns a complete 180. Although the ending was fairly satisfying, the book was so good I immediately had to get the other two and was not disappointed with how he ties everything together at the end of book 3.",5,1

Needed a decently spec'd tablet with good resolution to run Commander Mode and Battle-maps for Battlefield 4. It comes nicely boxed and charged! Performance is great, as it runs commander mode wonderfully, which is pretty demanding. Battery life is excellent, the screen size is a plus and the resolution is nice! The ability to access Google Play is a big relief, and all the bloat ware apps can be uninstalled or disable which is awesome! The build quality is also very nice, thin and feels solid. I was also shocked to see it had a mini HDMI port! My one complain would be that it doesn't charge via USB, so you have to use the included power adapter which has a short cord(2 feet). Though, I guess that's a very minor problem considering the price! Overall, this tablet has blown away my expectations... so much... that I will be going back today to buy a second one for rooting purposes.",5,1

So if you're a humorless Lefty who cannot imagine anyone poking fun at your sacred cows, go buy Al Franken's book and allow your sensibilities to remain unchallenged.

What I mean is that plot contrivances/devices and some motivations are so poorly rendered as to be wholly inexcusable.  Moreover, there should have been noted in the book that it is the first of a triology so that the reader is not left hanging after a hurried and totally unsatisfactory ending.  Even if she intended a cliffhanger, it fails as it most assuredly was not.  Further, who gives a flying flip if Ben/Amita's cooking is horrible?  Daniel flies halfway around the world for a critical message and the short visit revolves around cooking, with no apparent symbolism.

I also enjoyed the blu-ray menus which have rare posters of the film that shuffle through in the back ground.  The selecting the 35th anniversary blu-ray shadow cast segments weren't that interesting and could have been better produced.

7918515,Great for any fan of westerns,"This is the wild west at its worst- men who would do any immoral act for profit, or just for fun. At times their actions caused county-wide wars to break out during which dozens of men were killed. You'll read amazing stories in this book. There are chapters on Hickok, Plummer, Slade and Helm. The author was there at the time, and he quotes people who give first-hand accounts.",5,1

4435429,A great first step to taking control of your body,"Pursuing a healthy lifestyle can be a challenging task. One may not know where to begin or how to prioritize the information they've gathered. Reading &#8220;The Low Cholesterol Cookbook & Health Plan&#8221; is an exceptional stepping stone for those looking to get on track. Everyone should aim to live as healthy as possible, and by instilling the 1 + 1 - 1 Eating Plan you can begin to reap the benefits of a low cholesterol diet as you learn the differences between &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221; cholesterol. I highly recommend this book because it&#8217;s more than a cookbook and health plan that provides countless alternatives to the greasy and fatty foods we consume. Take control of your body and make some lifestyle adjustments today.",5,1

These really are good value for money.For hygiene, the brush and the part of the handle that fits inside the holder (the part not normally visible) are moulded white plastic.We bought 3 of these because our puppies had taken to making toys out of the plastic ones these replace.The manufacturers stickers removes easily, another brand I considered had terrible reviews based on how strong their label stuck.

3571031,Engaging piece of writing,"I must admit I was a little reserved about purchasing this book at first because of the poetry side of things, but from the moment I started reading I couldn't put it down and proceeded to read it in one sitting. I read alot and Slammed is the first book that has been able to bring out several different emotions out of me in a long time from a book. I cried...more than a few times through out the book but what I loved, was that it also made me laugh uncontrollably through fresh tears. The poetry side of things was interesting and engaging to read, some of it making me really think. It expressed the importance and value of family which really brought it home for me and of course the relationship between Lake and Will kept me ever so eagar for more. My Summary... I loved it.",5,1
8473764,Ray works in a funeral Parlor he is a serial Killer by night,Copy CatBy Brendan VervilleI really enjoyed reading this book. I don&#8217;t usually like crime shows or books but I thought I would give this one a try. Glad that I did .It held my attention and was a very exciting book. This is a bizarre crime story about a man who works in a funeral parlor and is a serial killer on the side. He is happy with his job until his victims start to show up as his customers in the funeral parlor. Then he decides to do a career change and move away. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes crime stories that are on the bizarre side. It will keep you captivated from start to finish.&#34;,5,1

8179929,Cute Book,This was a cute book. It was a very sweet romance. I loved the way the author wrote the main characters. I can't stand a weak h. Quinn (h) was a very straightforward woman and really loving but didn't take crap. Craig (H) was also very loving and wasn't willing to give up. My only problem with the book was that there were a few formatting issues. Four or Five times the sentence would just end with no finish. Also sometimes a characters name would change. Example: She would be thinking about Craig and then it was Jacob's name. Even with that I was not deterred. I would purchase a book from this author again.,4,1

6118142,A refreshingly new NUTCRACKER production,"Some say that the music of a country is best performed by artists in that country and this brilliant effort supports that view.  The dancing, lavish and colourful sets, orchestral playing under maestro Gergiev, are all top notch.  The choreography by Krill Simonov is new and different to that seen in most productions and this gives a freshness to the production.  Quite a few dances are traditionally performed by solo artists but here are danced by two or three together. Many of the presentations have new, elaborate and effective staging with great effects.  The music is very familiar to me and the overall result in 24 bit surround sound is both entertaining and musically satisfying.  A 12 year old ballet student and her family looked at it with us and everyone voted it ""great"".  Thoroughly recommended.",5,1
1141114,Good Read,"If you a looking for a good story, I recommend it.  If you are looking for high literature, like some of the reviews seem to be looking for, then read War and Peace.This story is interestingly different from the beginning.  Yes it stretches the imagination in places, but it's FANTASY, duh!  My acid test is: Do I identify with the characters, and this has a big YES for as an answer.",5,1

2760730,Was Christ really resurrected?,"That is the question that Charles Foster asked himself. Mr. Foster takes us on a journey as he takes part in a two sided argument about whether Jesus Christ was resurrected or not from the grave. In his book the Jesus Inquest he writes for and against the resurrection. After researching in libraries and visiting tombs, he takes us on a journey that many of us have been on. We have at one time or another asked ourselves if Christ has risen from the dead.By taking us through the medical evidence, burial practices, artifacts and many other evidences he gives the evidence for and against in a trial type setting. He asks and answers the questions from both sides of the resurrection debate. So what was the verdict? What does the evidence show? Did Christ come back from the dead? There is only one way to find out. You need to pick up this book to find out the answers to these questions. I guarantee that this book won't leave you hanging.",4,1

7920523,This Little Piggy Stayed Home,"I read ""Serial"" before I read ""Truck Stop"", as I suspect most people did since Serial was a free Kindle book. I sort of saw Serial coming as the second installment as I feverishly read Truck Stop. As I read Truck Stop I was locked onto my Kindle like Candi with an I was locked in stocks in the semi. What a terrific work of suspense blended with horror and cheese curds. Possibly the most attractive feature of Kilborne's prose is that its pictures are painted perfectly with just the right words. They are uniquely his and not a poor man's Stephen King like so many other horror writers I could name.Instead of rehashing the whole story from beginning to end and labelling it a review, I'll say this: I greatly enjoyed the characters, the suspense and the story. Kilborne carefully plotted and planned for this. This is a terrific story and I can't wait for the third installment.",5,1

7392519,"Great for video, has audio problems","After all of the great reviews, I was excited to get this product.  I cannot add anything to what other reviewers have said, other than the caveat that the BDP-103 drops audio (about 3-5 seconds) periodically, regardless of the type of media it is playing.  I have tried the recommended fix of changing the audio format settings to &#34;LPCM&#34;, which has lessened the problem, but not eliminated it.  Very disappointing in such an otherwise quality product.",2,0

My only real complaint is that it's a bit wide on me and high on the sides, so my armpits get poked slightly.",4,1
5350471,And I thought I knew where this was going...,"I have read many books and love a good thriller or murder mystery.  When I read the reviews I thought it was a good book to begin.  I was definitely drawn in.  The thing I liked the most about the book was the fact that it was not in the least predictable.  Just when I was sure I had it figured out, it took another twist and turn.  The ending was totally unexpected.  If you are looking for a good  read that will have you thinking about it long after you've read the last page, hold on to your hat you're in for a wild ride.",5,1
6705599,Useless,The features of this product are great...the problem is the clock constantly freezes and/or locks up.  Twice the alarm did not go off because the clock had frozen.  I returned the product for a replacement thinking maybe I got a dud.  Well the replacement does the same thing.  So I emailed the company to see what could be done.  Three suggestions were given:1.  Make sure you are using the iPhone dock adapter (well duh)2.  Turn the power off before inserting the phone (well ok but not sure how this would help the clock freezing in the future...it wasn't freezing when I was putting the phone in).3.  Power cycle the clock to reset...(ok I do this EVERY time it freezes).So bottom line works great to listen to music...but if you need a clock or an alarm (which is probably why you are looking at an ALARM CLOCK) then this is unreliable and completely useless...just like the company's support.,1,0
348069,Eye candy for train fans,"Kindle Fire HDX.For a free app, it's very nice. It's not a &#34;game&#34;, in that there is no real goal. You can start and stop the trains, speed them up and slow them down and basically drive around. There are a number of different views, engines and tracks. The views change depending on the engine selected. My favorite is the steam engine, and altho you can't control the engine from the interior view, it's still fun to look at. I realize from the product description that this was developed for the author's son, but if this were developed a bit more aggressively, I would probably pay for additional features. There are a few issues that I notice, stuff like graphics clipping and tearing, or sound loops that don't quite loop very well. I don't know if it is the Kindle Fire HDX or the app itself which is hyper-responsive to touch controls like pinch-n-zoom, but some of the touch controls were very erratic sometimes. Either way, still nice to sit back and zone out.",4,1
8690040,"Unintentionally funny, with one great battle scene","This may be the goofiest war movie ever made, an attempt to do a WWII-style flag waver smack in the middle of the Vietnam War.  Simplistic and cliched beyond words, badly directed and acted, the central part of the picture is, nevertheless, worth the price of admission.  A long, sustained night attack on a firebase is memorably staged and shot.  Seems a little clunky now, but no one had ever seen anything like this when the movie came out.  The rest is laughable, especially the mistakes: Wayne parachuting out of plane without hooking up; smashing what is obviously a Mattel toy M-16 against a tree (see the curved ""magazine""?); and, of course, the classic ending where the Sun sets in the East.",2,0

The white bit is important as all my appliances are white and I wanted a match. The flaw in the Samsung (deficient viewing angles;color negative picture 30 off) does not exist in this TV. Its ability to grab the house WiFi is phenomenal, and I no longer need to use the Roku box in the kitchen.The first reviewer did such a great job that all my operational questions were answered, but the aesthetic, there is white and there is white; this is not an appliance bright white like the Samsung was, it is more a creamy white.

I loved the characters, the plotting, the action scenes, the love and romance, the five brothers and their ability to totally stomp ass when needed and of course Dominus's dominance.

5677906,One of the true voices of Christmas,"There are certain singers you always hear on the radio at holiday time. Bing, Nat, Frank, Dino, Johnny, Perry, and Andy Williams. This CD consists mostly of songs that Andy himself selected. Most of them are from his red and green albums released in the 60s. Of course, his two signature holiday tunes are here, those being It's The Most Wonderful Time of the Year and Happy Holiday/The Holiday Season. Other songs that I like are My Favorite Things, The Bells of St. Mary's, Ring Christmas Bells, Sleigh Ride, Silver Bells and Winter Wonderland.There are 15 songs here, but the CD clocks it at about 40 minutes or so. They had room for more material. I also like Andy's versions of Let it Snow, Kay Thompson's Jingle Bells, A Song and a Christmas Tree (The 12 Days of Christmas) and his version of Ave Maria. That would make this CD better, but it's a good selection of Andy's best. He and Johnny Mathis are arguably two of the best living interpreters of holiday music.",4,1

The selection of included photographs was also a treat & included some things that I had not seen before in other books.

1476017,I adored this book....,"I read this book second instead of first and I have to say it was better than a &quot;Rake's Vow&quot;. Honoria was just great. Her character was well developed and you truley just loved her. Devil was an angle in diguise. I loved their interaction together. Both gave the other fair warning about how they thought thier relationship would end ~~ with Devil saying he was going to marry her and Honoria saying she most certainly was not going to marry him.The romance was great. Love scenes were not rushed. They went along with the story instead of seeming like filler. And the tracking of the murder was also pretty good. (Loved when Honoria always hit on some detail that Devil had missed.) Honoria was not dimwhitted, she proved her worth time and time again. I loved this book I could go on and on and ramble until my heart was content, but I don't want to ruin anything for you. Pick this book up and read it. You will not be disapointed.",5,1

7548528,Worth every penny if just to cut those onions!,"Like other reviewers, I hate cutting onions, and I was thrilled with the nearly instant work that this chopper made of two medium onions. I just chopped each in half, took off the outer couple of layers, and threw them in. A couple of quick pulses and I had dry eyes and very nicely diced onions ready for my cooking project.I agree with the complaints about the inside top of the unit being hard to clean because it is attached to the motor. It would have been so much better if there was some kind of a liner to toss in the dishwasher. But I am sure I will manage to get the top clean enough for my standards. The only problem will be taking care of it right away before food dries on it.I read through every single review to see how other people are using this little machine. Lots of great ideas. I hope to try them, and I will never cry alone in my kitchen again, no matter how many onions need to be chopped.",4,1

The machine rattles because of the screw.  Since it was a bargain at under $20, it was something I could live with.  I didn't care for the main recipe as I prefer my grandmother's.  3/4 cup semolina flour to each egg- don't forget salt too.

7928414,Picks up speed and then flies to a soaring finish,"This YA oriented book was a find for a middle aged reader.  There is some difficulty with the beginning.  So much information is thrown out that I ended up putting the book down until I could give it more attention...and I can usually juggle several books at one time.  That may make this one tougher for your YA to hook onto.That said, once the characters were all introduced and a basic plot established, the story began to take flight and capture the imagination in a very strong grip.  Mira is a strong leader who improves those around her using what she learned during all those years at home.  The fact that this class ultimately pulls together into a team, not based on deals and prearranged promises but on the reliance of the strengths of the individuals working toward a singular goal, is the ultimate flight.I look forward to reading the other books in this series.",5,1
1397892,Keeps you interested,"""On Fire's Wings"" was a really good, action-packed, keep-you-reading novel from the Luna imprint, which I've found to be hit-or-miss so far.  The plot is pretty straightforward, but Golden is really setting up a complex world that you hope she'll explore more in later books.  There's also a rich history before ""On Fire's Wings"" takes place that you sort of want explained - exactly how and why did they succeed or fail on previous attempts?  I'm taking a star off because I was absolutely appalled by something that happened in the middle of the book (keep reading, you'll see what I mean), but after I got past that part and it was explained why it happened, it was a bit more acceptable.",4,1

2232398,Living Mythology,"This book is an interesting juxtaposition of travelogue and mythology.  As a child, Storace was fascinated with the stories and characters of Greek mythology.  This led to a life-long fascination with Greece and Greeks, not only of the ancient culture, but as they are today.  In this book, Storace takes us on a journey to her Greece, a land that is inseparable from its mythic past.  She narrates to us stories of people she met in Greece, repeating the stories they told her, all the while relating the stories to the ancient tales from Greek mythology.  As a travel journal, the book is a little heavy on allusions and symbolism and a little light on realistic imagery.  But direct descriptions of events is not what this book is about-instead it is the personal story of how Storace finds meaning in Greek culture through her own integration of history, mythology and observation of contemporary society.",4,1

This Spanish-language version gives homegrown accounts of the nation that has been haunted by her legacy ever since.Evita was a study in contrasts, Dior dresses worn when giving donations to the poor, too much flashing of money while lambasting the rich, and being First Lady when all she could do was act.

As Laura Hunt, Gene Tierney is visually exquisite and her performance is very convincing (in the original novel, the title character was quite different, she being rather amoral). Dana Andrews is most effective as Mark McPherson, the detective who ""falls in love with a phantom..."" Vincent Price is unlikeably weak as Shelby whose close friend Anderson explains about their mutual admiration of each-other ""We're weak and can't seem to help it"" Lastly, as Waldo Lydecker, Clifton Webb is simply excellent.

This is sturdy and makes coffee well like the glass ones.  I would have given it 5 stars if it had been made in America and came with an all metal strainer.  I'm not very comfortable drinking anything that resulted from boiling water being poured over any type of plastic. When I called the Bodum people and asked them why this was not all made of metal, they told me that it was made of plastic and silicone to avoid scratching the inside of the stainless steel pot.  I don't care if the inside gets a little scratched, and so I took the all metal strainer assembly from my broken glass carafe and screwed it into the metal lid of the new pot.  Problem solved, and I can easily replace this part should I ever need to because this pot is the same size as a Bodum glass carafe and the parts are interchangable.",4,1

Young also presents the material well and in a logical manner; she is also good at explaining many things.  However, some (few) things are not explained well, leaving the reader confused.  Most of the chapters are rather thorough; however, the last two chapters that involve editing are not as developed or informative as they should be.",4,1
2343383,Much Ado about Nothing,This novel is more about the power of the press to do harm when they interfere too soon in investigations they know little or nothing about.  I enjoyed the book because it shows the insider's point of view in this type of situation and how it can spiral out of control.,5,1
1235152,Worth a read.,"I thought it was a good read, suspenseful. I did feel the ending was not explained well as to why the final killer felt it necessary to kill the character. I would recommend reading it if you like a lot of twists and turns to a plot.",4,1

Gustainis has some great characters, a good story, and plenty of potential for a series.  I laughed out loud several times early in the book; it's dark humor, it's funny, and it keeps on throughout the book.  Markowski is flawed - the best and most real protagonists are - and he's trying to do better, trying not to make the same mistake twice.  The female characters, although few and far between, are strong and believable.  I'm looking forward to the next one.",4,1

1353616,Prequel to Prequels,"This book describes the beginning of the Earth-Bugger conflict. In Ender's game both the First and Second Formic Wars are mentioned. This book leads up to the first formic war. Be advised that the reader is left hanging.The novel is more like Enders Game than Speaker for the Dead and subsequent books in this series. This probably explains why some don't like it. The book is an action novel not a reflective piece. Further, the book has several separate plots, some of which don't even come together in this book which makes remembering and following the separate characters very hard. (Think some of the Tom Clancy novels)Still, if you loved Ender's Game, youll love this book. Cards imaginative description of asteroid miners is masterful.

7887567,Bottoms Up!,"I absolutely love a great cup of coffee in the morning with my Keurig K-Cup coffee brewer. But yet, I do feel the need to try and find easier ways to make my own coffee without having the use of problems with just going through the expensive knocks of having to buy the disposable cups. Cafe Cup is something I definitely was surprised by, when I had the desire of getting my Keurig brewer for coffee, and it was as one of the few As Seen On TV products I have seen in awhile that works well for its money. Not only does it work nicely for my coffee, but it is a great concept for anyone that doesn't want to go for the route with buying a Keurig only filter. My one gripe though is that it can be a bit messy to clean, but it is worth the money. If you have one of the K-Cup machines by Keurig, I definitely suggest you get the Cafe Cup, and use your own ground coffee for the best cup around.Price: B+Convience: B-Overall: B 1/2+",4,1

6687059,computer good so far... Amazon spec is off,"the computer is good so far... the thing is about the Amazon specas of Oct 6, 2008, the spec on this page says resolution is:1440 x 900 pixelshowever, the box printing says 1680 x 1050 and the hp.com spec says 1680 x 1050 also.so that means the font will be smaller...  I bought this computer partly based on the fact that IQ804 and IQ816 are both 25 inch screen and is 1920 x 1200.  I thought this one is 1440 x 900 and therefore it is more comfortable for it being a touch screen computer.  When the resolution is too high, the dot density is too high, making it less comfortable for using the finger to pinpoint something to ""click"" it.Turns out that 1920 / 25.5  and 1680 / 22 give about the same dot density, as both are about 75 or 76.",4,1

3681363,A fun read,"Thirty Postcards Away was translated from Spanish to English as it was written by a Spanish author who lives in Malaga, Spain as does her main character Sofia who lives in an apartment on the thirteenth floor of a high rise. Early in her move she takes the elevator and there is a handsome man in it that lives on the twelfth floor, Jamie. The two of them start a tentative relationship. Jamie is anally organized and Sophia not so much. Jamie is divorced and involved with the woman who was the other woman in the relationship. Sophia has just gotten out of a bad relationship. Plenty of humor,pathos and emotion comes through this romantic story. I'm not quite sure how to categorize it--somewhat a contemporary romance, but it has more depth than many of the other books that are categorized in this genre.",4,1
684675,A Charming Devil,"From the moment in his boyhood when the mischievous Tristan Burke climbs under eight-year-old Joan's bed to hide from her parents you just know he's going to grow up to be a devilish, heart-breaker.  Joan, the heroine, is a bit reminiscent of Penelope in Julia Quinn's Bridgerton Series, dressed in unsightly, tricked-out frocks.  But our hero, Tristan, quickly dispels that image by helping the reader see beyond that mass of flashy flounces that Joan's mother insists she wear. He has just enough swagger to be sexy without that extreme level of pomposity that tends to render so many heroes nothing short of jerky.  No jerk in this novel; just a fun, fresh and charming devil of a man capable of stripping the ""umbrella dress"" off of our heroine with his eyes...and oh so much more.",5,1

Hollywood's best (Elizabeth Taylor at an age my generation won't recognize, and Dennis Hopper in a surprise smaller role) play in this story that confronts big topics such as inter-generational transfer, racism, and faulty attempts at personal growth.It's a heavy and long movie - best seen in 3 parts over 3 nights.

I have had some that are almost flexible when they are plugged in, this one is solid. Does not move at all while plugged in.

Her excitement was infectious.I finished the series I was reading and dove head first into Tattoo Thief.  I loved it!  I'm sure there are a lot of young women who can relate to Beryl.  Don't know what to do with their lives yet not yet content with settling for the one they have.  Sadly many do settle, with regrets ((raises hand)), but accept the hand they chose.

I actually bought the expanded version of their one major hit CD, ""The Final Countdown"" - I thought it was great and my fave track was not even one of their big popular songs. Anyway, I picked this one up, 'cause it was really cheap and these days, you can't usually find good bands for cheap. Yeah, I know that sucks. This is a really great CD which I did not know was new, until I read the back of the case while I listened to it. Anyway, this is a solid, from-the-heart effort by an obscure 80's sensation, who hopefully will rise to glory again. Until then, I really like this CD, and Hair Metal is not the right term for this kind of music...more like alt-progressive glam.",5,1

3087994,A terrifying and necessary story,Had to give up reading (it) in bed at night and settle for lunchtime reading instead--scared me that much (and I'm not easily scared). But it's precisely because things like this have happened--and are still happening somewhere in the world--that this read is so unsettling (and only a very capable writer like Sirota can make it all feel so horribly real). Pick it up--you'll never forget Freedom's Hand (and you shouldn't).,5,1
3139772,A Great Book From One Of Our Best Authors,"I am a big fan of Perotta's - most recently finishing the 2012 Best Short Stories anthology that he edited.  I primarily knew him for his novels The Leftovers and Election.  Nine Inches is one of the best short story collections I have read in years; contemporary, often very funny and touching stories that ring true, but also often offer a really pleasant surprise.  Perotta's writing is lovely and precise, and after reading this book I immediately ordered Bad Haircut, one of his earlier short story collections. Highly recommended!",5,1
783885,Chris Mooney just gets better and better,"Just finished the Soul Collectors. Sent to Amazon UK for the book since it is not available in the States, which I find infuriating!! But the book is beyond amazing. Darby is one the most intriguing female characters in this genre. Her relentless drive to find the truth and punish those responsible for unnspeakable crimes is the foudation of her personality. She is independent, honest, driven, and fearless. Couple this with her empathy for the victim, her ability to cry (when no one can see her),and the depth of her feelings to those close to her and you have one pretty amazing lady! I am a big fan of Chris Mooney and highly recommend his books. Please read them in order, starting with Deviant Ways and then The Missing, Dead Room and Secret Friend. You will not be disappointed.

It was sexy without being trashy and was well written with compelling characters.The suspense was great and took me on an emotional roller coaster. I will absolutely be buying the second book in this series.",5,1

I do flip flop between Fodor's and Lonely Planet being my favorites because each author is just different, but in this case Lonely Planet has hit it out the park. Granted there aren't a ton of travel guides (especially for New Mexico), but this one was especially funny and filled with great advice. I love the history and the quirky places it helps you find, as well as basic information. This one in particular had some great itineraries. I only wish it had included Texas as well (or at least the towns on Route 66 in Texas) since this is a great guide for those traveling on 66 or I-40.",5,1

True, this isn't great literature at its finest, but for what it is --a Romantica novelette-- it's fantastic!I thought the main character was well-written and easy to relate to, and her romantic interest was certainly an awesome fantasy! The scene is light kink, nothing remotely over-the-top or anything. Take the negative reviews here with a grain of salt; most of them didn't know what they were getting into with an Evangeline Anderson book, so they're negative about the length and simplicity (duh, it's a novelette!), or the graphic content (duh, it's erotica!).All in all, it's a sweet little story.",4,1

You could feel the chemistry between Sin and Emily right from the start, I kept thinking have sex already geesh. I loved how Sin told Emily to beg for him, they just sizzled.

I felt their pressure from voters back home and fellow legislators. I now better understand what is expected of each member and how many bosses they may have.One eye opener was the story about the Bureau of Public Debt and the selling of Treasury Bills and U.S. Savings Bonds, felt bummed after hearing that.Term Limits might be in our future.

His father made his money by slaughtering animals, everything Daria fights against.  Not to mention Paul's love of a good steak when it comes time to celebrate.

3564157,This book one of my favorite counting books!!,"As you can figure out by my name, I love monkeys! The book's rhyme was catchy and was more than simply counting from one to ten as it told a story about a mischievous monkey who stole items belonging to other animals and people.  For example, for number two, there is a fun rhyme about a dog hiding his two bones with a picture illustrating the dog's actions. The next picture shows the dog looking into the hole where he'd buried his bones and now it held two bananas instead of his bones. After the number ten, there is a picture showing all of the little monkey's loot. How everyone got their stolen items back would spoil the story. I had not anticipated the ending at all. Good story! Another reviewer mentioned maybe purchasing this book in paperback, and I might do that, too. This book is a keeper for sure, and is a new favorite!

My boys love looking at the pictures right after I take them and the handy screen on the back is a plus for all of us.  When you're taking pictures of three kids you sometimes can't get everyone looking and/or smilling at the same time.  With this camera I don't waste money on developing pictures that aren't up to my standards.  I wind up taking at least 3-4 pictures before I get exactly what I want and then I just go back through the photos and erase what I don't want.  It's so easy to download the pictures to Shutterfly.com and order right from there!  This camera is a must!",5,1

I also like the fact that they are open air and do not shut you off from your surroundings.  This is an especially nice feature if you live in an urban area, IMHO. These ear buds are also very comfortable and the wind up case is a BIG plus (why couldn't Apple include something like this with theirs?)

The chart explaining what % of Daily Values means for various ingredients solved a particular longtime label reading mystery for me. My favorite aspect of the book, however, is the arrangement of the recipes by calorie count at the end of the book, making it a very useful reference for meal planning. The book also features a swappable suggested 8 day meal plan and a list of kitchen tools that every home cook will find useful.

With first cousins interbreeding you will get some very strange mutations.  I'm just surpised there weren't any physical deformaties mentioned.On the whole I have to say that I'm glad I borrowed this from the library rather than buying it.

While the author does an excellent job, painting the characters and the scenes, the characters are very unlikeable,  She also bounces back an forth between story lines as well as the past and the present.  This makes it challenging to see where all this is headed.  And the ending leaves you cold.  I read it for book club and that was the group concensus as well.  Not one of our better selections.",2,0

I should of listened to the other reviews about this, in that the actual haunting is barely covered, what is covered is the astral projections, spirit guides, trying to get the church to help. The storyline degenerates into total idiocy if you ask me, with, and a SPOILER ALERT HERE !!! the lead character, playing chess with the devil for her soul, sorry, but as we say here in NZ, 'yeah, right !'

4444668,Sometimes Hidden Secrets Have Lasting Effects,"The Tillman family matriarch, Mother Tillman, along with her son and daughter-in-law have harbored a secret for years. But when events beyond their control surface, there are lasting consequences that will alter the lives of the entire family.""Raising Redemption"" by R.A. Russell was one of those novels that you read and don't want to put down. You will read into the night just to see the outcome.  I really enjoyed the novel. My only complaint was the skiing scenes. They were a little too detailed and took up a lot of the novel, but I understood the need to establish Alexi's part in the story.""Raising Redemption"" was a very well written, thought-provoking novel.  There was great character development with all of the characters.  He outlined the time frame very well and I found the story line refreshing. A great story of love, lost, restoration and a renewed hope.I would highly recommend this novel. Although quite long, it will keep you engaged until the last page.Reviewed by: Lisa M.4.5 stars",4,1
8862095,River's Edge,"This movie was good, I watched it because of Ione Skye.  The subject matter was the rebellious teens and the adults that tried to act like teens.  This was a movie in my opinion about lost morals, lost hope and a wish to ruin as many lives as possible.  Parents were non existent in their child's life and the ones that were had no goals to raise their kids.For me the lack of any morals to even feel after a death is to far fetched to imagine. Keanu Reeves does his 60 ies hippie impression while trying to remain out of the influences of the rest of the group.I had a hard time liking any of the people depicted in this movie.  If Denis Harper tried to make everyone watching hate him, he did a good job.This was not an uplifting movie but I was able to enjoy Ione Skye and that is why I watched it.",4,1

What is less well known is that Andra has a superb sense of humor. This is a distinctive asset in Conflict Unraveled: Fixing Problems At Work And In Families in which she distills her many years of experience and expertise in a volume specifically written and presented so as to be fully accessible to the non-specialist general reader. This wonderful compendium of observations, advice, strategies, tactics, insights, and illustrations is something of a complete and very highly recommended &quot;how to&quot; course on conflict resolution whether in the home or in the workplace.",5,1

3012720,An Excellent Series.,"After Siren&#8217;s Song, I made sure that this headed to the top of my queue bypassing other reads. Back is protagonist Jack (Obadiah Jackson), our high-action hero in the vein of Indiana Jones who heads ENIGMA, the seekers of cryptids. In this case the cryptids are the Jersey Devils, a much bandied about legend of gargoyle-like creatures equal to the lore of Bigfoot, and, in reality, claimed to have been seen by some. But in Devil&#8217;s Child, after a friend was attacked, Jack heads to New York where he begins to find the truth behind the Jersey Devil, only to be mired by political feuding with town constituencies. But this is only the beginning of finding the truth behind the myth, of the 9-foot gargoyles running havoc. This is an action/adventure through and through. Since I enjoyed Siren&#8217;s Song to the nth degree, this book is no different.",5,1
2482143,Terrific,Terrific series and terrific book.  I couldn't put it down and since reading the entire Malazan series have placed it at the top of my favorite fantasy epics list.

1748752,Wonderful!,"The author writes a wonderful whimsical story.  There is a lot of catholicism in this book, but I didn't take it as an attempt to convert people (as some readers apparently did).

I gave it a try because it was free and now I am willingly going to pay to get the follow-up books.  I thought it was well written and compelling.It is about a girl who is moved to a new place where she is most definitely the outsider.  Different religion (wiccan), different way of dressing, city girl in the country, and the popular girl hates her.  It should be very cliche, but I came to really like the characters.

The characters came alive and became friends I wanted to be in my life and never leave. The romance is beautiful and real.  The author makes it possible to actually feel every emotion as you take the journey with Will and Layken as they fall in love. I felt like I was young and in love again for the first time.

I can hardly say 1 bad thing about  this cd except does anyone know where on earth that Lovemongers song  appears?? I've watched that movie tons of times &amp; have never heard it.

Starring the master of fright Vincent Price, this movie includes many tricks and gimmicks that aren't so much scary as entertaining. Even with the poorly rendered haunts and spooks, it's easy to see why Price has reigned the haunted silver screen. Once you get past the true-to-era ""special effects,"" you'll ultimately become a fan, and fall under the spell of the mesmerizing Price. Easily realizable as to why he is such a favorite to stars such as Tim Burton and Johnny Depp.",5,1

Of course, the book also shared sample menus that are quick and easy to prepare.

YHF finds him seamlessly blending great songwriting with electronic freakout, although sometimes he goes a little over the edge with the found sounds and electronics.  The CD has a lazy, stoned feel to it throughout, which is undoubtedly the condition in which it was created.He's opening for REM on part of their tour, although this music lends itself much better to a club than an arena, because this is very intimate, F'd up music that is best appreciated up close.",4,1

4232295,The Best Graphic Novel Available!,"I was very reluctant to spent $175 on this book but am very happy I did; this is a phenomenal graphic novel.  I am a big Moebuis fan so was tempted to buy this, and then did some research.  It is available in other editions, for instance you could piece it together in various parperbacks or get the French copies.  But that would still be expensive and this is the unedited, uncensored version, from the original art proofs, in its full glory in one beautiful package.  The story is fantastic.  If you are a fan of Blade Runner, The Fifth Element or noir pulp ficticon (like Raymond Chandler) you will like this.  The story is intricate and thoughtful and the art is stunning top quality Moebius.  I highly recommend getting a copy if you can afford it.  Perhaps they will reprint this, but it came out in 2010 so I expect it will not be for at least a couple of more years until the movie (long rumored) is released.  Highest Recommendation!",5,1

Although it was rare for me not to recognize the many many references to gaming and 80's culture, I don't think it would deter anyone younger from enjoying this book. It certain would help to be a gamer of some type, but again, I don't think it would be a deal breaker. The characters and near future plot are believeable and intriguing.

Bewitched is a refreshing break from those shows when TV sitcoms started dealing with racy issues.  Elizabeth Montgomery shines and Agnes Morehead sparkles! During the 8th season, producers and writers started re-visiting old storylines from previous seasons; but gave them a new twist.  There are  two episodes where Esmerelda conjures up George and Martha Washington.  In these two episodes, George was arrested for inciting a riot.  Aunt Clara in previous years had conjured up Ben Franklin and the George Washington episodes followed the same theme with Ben getting arrested, also.

While it is deliberately paced  (read SLOW for some impatient viewers not familiar with Cronenberg's  style)it is nonetheless a worthwhile investment of time and thought.  I  liked it much better than Matrix, and I'm not exactly a Cronenberg fan.  It  should be seen a few times to really take in the complex layering of  realities.

Once the initial joy wore off of listening to this album that defied executives, the real critical ear went to work. The album is dry. The songs tend to run too long and there is a bit too much noise. They can be borderline irritating, and this comes from a listener who tends to like more experimental sounds and artists that have an acquired taste. This album is a must-have simply for the story, but for the music, it's best to stop with &quot;Summer Teeth&quot;.",2,0

2856058,Great start for a new series,"I have to wholeheartedly agree with pretty much all the points V. Nelson (amother reviewer) makes. This book is a great read packed with action and the low price makes it all the more satisfying.I did feel Amber was a little bit coflicted in her personality, sometimes sounding much older while other times much younger than someone with her experiences. The romance comes into play much later in the book going from a trickle to almost immediately a raging waterfall, especially that with Alex. We get so much wonderful action, mystery throughout the book with other great relationships (functional and dysfunctional alike) the romance is not up to par with the rest of the material.Having said all that i think its definitely a great book and page turner ( Yes, I stayed up late reading it too) and I do look forward to reading more about Amber, and once again I second the comment of not making Amber into a sleeze, this story has way more to offer than that.

Guns, martial arts, and occult spellcasting galore is an understatement! Cordelia(Charisma Carpenter) is one of the sexiest women I have ever seen! Her sad return and farewell(not giving away TOO much) will make you cry, even if you're a &#34;tough guy&#34;. SHOCK ENDING TO THE SERIES! You will never guess what happens.

The plots at a Nation level are completely believable. Brown adds some interesting slants to the historical record. National leaders are added a just the right level and amount. The various institutions-civil or military-are presented and represented at a human level. Lastly, the changing interactions amongst the protagonists could have been an adequate book in itself. Mr. Brown could have taken the easy way out to resolve all the various plots but he did not. That is what makes this book so good..he ended the book the way real life would end..yet I think he left the door for more slightly ajar. This is a rare 5 star from me but the book earned it.

The plot has many twists are turns, so the conclusion is far from  predictable.  The book ties up some lose ends from the previous book. One of the best things about this book is that it had me second guessing who the villain was. If I thought it was one person, the next page or chapter would somehow prove me wrong. I love not knowing right away who the villain is and trying to put the clues together just like the two main detectives in the story, Jade and Maddie.

There are so many better books without all the personal stories (which don't add a speck of substance to the book). Very little detail about how to format the book, not much on marketing your book that wasn't probably gleaned from elsewhere. For formatting and ebook design, get Stephanie Zia or Kate Harper instead (Kate writes about articles but it's excellent detail about formatting for Kindle); for marketing go with John Locke or the Smashwords ebook.  Really, this one's too thin, too useless for a serious writer/publisher to find useful.",1,0
4602913,Well Written Page-Turner!,"&#34;I gave him a teaspoon of truth and a barrel of concoction.&#34; That line from Shelley Fraser Mickle's book has given me a perfect way of hereafter acknowledging any detour from the absolute truth that I may find it necessary to utter. Brilliant! I so appreciated receiving this very interesting Civil War history lesson wrapped up in the life story Eliza, a women born to a prostitute in a New Orleans fancy house, who launches herself away from all that is familiar in order to determine her own destiny. Altogether this novel is a marvelous way to absorb part of this era in our American story.",5,1

7318949,Fantastic 50mm prime,"I'm pretty much in love with this lens. Works fantastically in low light and for portrait shots. Excellent bokeh. This lens is SHARP and clean. The zoom is very noisy however, and the plastic body feels cheap compared to heavier lenses. I find that a 50mm is a little too much zoom for me. I wish I had a 30mm 1.4 or 1.8, but that's on the wish list. This is a great add-on for a K-5 or a K-7 kit lens. The kit lenses just don't do that great in low light, and this blows it out of the water in certain situations.",5,1

A set of strong core characters and period setting keep me entertained, even if the mysteries aren't necessarily always top-notch who-done-it's. Throw in guest appearances from historical figures and some cheeky pop references (&#34;the Murdoch identity&#34;) and it's all good fun. This is also a very wholesome show, with some minor references to sex and regular murders, but nothing graphic or explicit is involved. Finally, the main character has a good set of values that he sometimes questions, so he doesn't come across as cartoonishly wholesome and feels &#34;real&#34;.",4,1

I really enjoyed seeing Cy blossom when Web was around and I thought Web went through the journey he needed to go through. I liked the kids and his unapologetic attitude to things.

Although the book isn't great, and has no real substance to it, Gwen Cooper's writing makes you not want to put the book down (after page 100 or so!). Her writing keeps you up intil 2 am trying to figure out of her main character Amy reaches social heights or falls flat on her face. The life that her main character lives is what drew me to this book, and in it, if you know the right people, wear the right outfit and get into the part fashionably late and past all of the crowds (with having to pay no cover fee to boot!) then you're instantly ""in"" in South Beach.

It is well if closely written (if you aren't patient enough to read through details of battles, this book is not for you) and extremely credible, with events and characters better drawn then in the work of such well known alternate history writers as Turtledove and Conroy.  The last pages of the book hint at one or more sequels--I certainly hope so.",5,1

He and the other guys were somehow involved in Danley Dimmel getting hurt.It takes Julian a while to get around to that which happened over Christmas break, but in the meantime, he writes about what happens on the block and at school, all the way through the end of the school year. These include some hijinx that only 12-year-old boys find fun, and those first crushes.I did find it slow-going at first, but I'm so glad I stuck with it.

So Sam Spade gets a little tiresome when he never lets down his guard, even when drugged out, mugged or threatened with arrest for murder.On the other hand, this is the classic Hollywood detective movie of the early 40's.  So we expect the cast iron character of the detective caught in a cesspool of intrigue.Lot's of fun with the old stereotypes. Mary Astor as the devious female client, perhaps not as glamorous today as portrayed (&#34;you'll want to see her - she's a knockout&#34;), Sidney Greenstreet as the &#34;fat man&#34; who instigated it all,  and above all Humphrey Bogart as the invincible detective who's going to get to the bottom of this mess.A good classic Hollywood detective movie - if you like that sort of thing.",4,1

ABC really blew it by not promoting this show. THe first episode in which Rodney decides to help out by taking on some duties for the preacher is a side splitter. His great relationship with his friend Barry and his family make this a family friendly show. It is like my family anyway. Rodney's spontaneaous humor is not stifled by this show. Mac Davis as his father in law and the rest of the cast are great. I notice several country stars in supporting roles in the first set and I know there are some in this also.

678860,What grit,So hard to believe that treatment of these children could go unnoticed for so long.  Book is so well written and told.  Hard to put down.  Great to hear the children were able to get back together in such a loving fashion and amazing how Regina was able to put her life together after such a difficult childhood.  Blessings to her and her family.,5,1
2429333,A Rocking Road Trip of Self Discovery,"A road trip filled with adventures of discovery both internal and external. Exploring and understanding as pieces start to fall into place with Kerouac's ""Dharma Bums"", maps and a journal. Searching for God, a better understanding life and death, sexuality while  finding oneself in between teenage angst complicated by a parent's death and it's rippling affects.  Some may be put off by one searching for God, doing drugs and maybe being lesbian; it's a rocking good read!",4,1
8996736,"Fine acting, and a nice introduction to a great poet...","I saw this on PBS back around 1979, and it started a frustrating love affair with the poet which culminated in my writing a play which is kind of a sequal to this. I corresponded with the playwright, William Luce, and with Richard Sewall, Emily's most respected biographer. I have come to see that Bill Luce's portrait of Dickinson may not be a faithful exhibit of her real personality, but as an introduction to her thoughts it serves a good purpose. Julie Harris is superb, of course. If you want a painless way to get to know the background of Emily's life, this is it.",5,1
4512125,"Pointless, dull, and ill-written; neither science fiction nor fantasy","This is subtitled ""The Chronicles of Hope."" Let us hope that it is the one and only such ""chronicle."" With an irritating main character, sloppy writing, no real plot, and no conclusion, this book is a waste of money even at 99 cents. It's neither science fiction nor fantasy; just classify it as ""an inane political novel."" Possibly I should have given it one star, but I kept reading because I couldn't believe it would never develop any plot or any interest. I was wrong.",2,0
7224402,Worth the price,With this accelerated charger I recharged my Kindle Fire HD from a 21% available battery power to 100% battery power in 3.5 hours.  I had been using the charging cord from my old Kindle DX (instead of the USB charger which requires an overnight charge)and that required almost 9 hours to recharge from 19% available battery power.  This is worth the purchase if only in the assurance that your Kindle is not out of commission for a much longer time period.  Don't hesitate !,5,1
8983941,Beautiful family comedy!!!!,"I yearn for a family like the one depicted in this Steve Martin gem!  Imagine twelve kids, the overflowing love, oh excuse me I'm rambling!  I'm experiencing what is often called empty-nest syndrome; in other words, I don't have a husband or any kids.  It doesn't mean I can't hope, and a movie like this makes me even more hopeful that even in my middle-age I will still find my prince charming (or a good sperm donor at least).  Even though Hilary 'Heathen' Duff is a bad influence on youngsters (as is Ashton Kutcher, seen in a cameo), I would recommend this to God-fearing families across the states!",5,1

I would have been totally satisfied with just that chapter as the whole book. I had to stop, and regain my sense after just the first chapter. So freaking HOT! However Red Phoenix, just surpasses herself in chapter 2, so romantic, while still utterly erotic. The story is awesome.

Things go smoothly, but there are complications in Sabrina's life that she's not willing to talk about until they threaten to spoil her prospects for the future.I enjoyed the banter between Sabrina and Reynaldo at their initial meeting. Ms. Diamond did a great job of conveying his attractiveness and the spark between himself and Sabrina.I like the fact that these characters cut right to the chase and that the writer includes a problematic situation that doesn't seem contrived. This novella left me wanting to read Second Chances, to see how their relationship develops.",5,1

6987285,Great managed switch.  Have not had a single problem. Very snappy response when configuring the unit.,"While a tad pricier than consumer switches, I don't think you can buy a better small business switch.  I've had two in place for a couple of months and piped terabytes of traffic through them without a single hiccup.  The response is very good on the configuration web page - I noticed other switches can be a bit laggy, but not this one.  I thought at first I may have bought more switch than I need, but I have been very happy with the quality of these.  I work with Catalyst switches in the office, so I have high expectations for switch performance and configurability.  While this isn't a Catalyst switch, it isn't as expensive as a Catalyst.  While it is a bit more expensive than a retail consumer switch, the quality and performance far exceed a retail units I've used; justifying the cost.  I've had to reset retail units on a regular basis, but these have not required any intervention after setup.",5,1

And he managed to be all of these things nearly simultaneously, all the while chomping on cigars, laughing uproariously, and having the most magnificent time.

486205,"Mediocre attempt that really is not in search of ""Paul""","Crossan and Reed here make a really poor attempt to do several things, provide a historical, sociological, anthropological, and religious context to the world of the historical Paul, while at the same time present a modern travelogue and archaelogical primer of Paul's world. But at the same time, they attempt an exegesis of Paul's writings, give themselves literary license to rewrite scripture, and try to downplay or even declare wrong whole portions of the New Testament.  They obviously started the book with a clear agenda to challenge and find illegitimate non ""politically correct"" portions of the New Testament and so the title is completely misleading.  While obviously everyone is entitled to their own views on scripture, this attempt at religious revisionism is absurd, especially when these authors pretend to do it under the guise of scholarship.",2,0

My oven's motor stopped working November 2011 and the contact number in the book that came with the item was disconnected.  I Googled Halo Oven and found an operating number. Five days later I had a new motor at shipping cost. The customer service rep was polite and apologized for my inconvenience with the telephone #.

I had previously read it when I was in school, many years ago.Obviously, it seems dated now, but at the same time, the story of Stearn's time at the ashram and his experience with how yoga changed his life, is still interesting and compelling.I'm a big fan of yoga and have been for many years. I didn't need any convincing when it comes to believing in what a regular hatha yoga practise can do for a person. It has helped me so much and in so many ways. Re-reading this book, I wondered if Stearn had continued his yoga practise, after returning to real life in New York, after his extended yoga retreat.",4,1

These kits are very well made and all holes lined up perfectly with all needed hardware included and simple, clear instructions/illustrations for assembly.I recommend staining the pieces before assembly- so easy to do. Then put it together and whallah!With a nice, thick mattress the bed is indeed nice and high off the ground- something to consider if it is for small children. More dangerous than an average height bed, should they fall off. I find it perfect for me, however, and the storage space underneath is equivelant to a good size closet, which I greatly appreciate in my small apartment. I have purchased the underbed drawer kit which I look forward to staining and assembling for use under this bed.Highly recommended!",5,1

8458036,Very Informative and Helpful,"Bipolar Disorder is an often misunderstood diagnosis that carries a lot of negative social stigma associated with it. Many people hear the work bipolar and they automatically think &#34;crazy&#34;. People with bipolar are not insane, and is not something to tease or joke around about.What I really liked about this book is that author explains in detail what Bipolar Disorder is, the signs and symptoms and explains how it is diagnosed and treated. It is a great book for friends and family members to read so that they can have a better understanding about what is going on with their loved one.For the bipolar person, this book explains the difference between manic, depressive and hypomania episodes and gives the benefits of different types of treatment and therapy options.I found the book fascinating, just from a psychological level, but it also helped me to understand my best friend better.",5,1

2180561,Thought I Knew How America Was Born,"But I learned otherwise. This book did an excellent job of explaining the reality behind many of our national myths. And showing us the real people behind the myths we've made of the Founding Fathers.The author wrote this to inform the reader of the many highly critical accomplishments of American Patriots prior to 1776, leading to our de-facto nationhood before Independence had even been declared. And this information is critical to understanding how &#34;a rag-tag army of frontiersmen&#34; could take on &#34;the world's greatest army&#34; and win.In fact, the author shows that the Americans, despite having serious equipment shortages, were so much better organized than the British, that in hindsight, American success was not only possible, but perhaps even likely.Have never read better, more informative material on the political, religious, ethnic, financial, and cultural battles being fought between the various groups of Americans, both immigrant and native, culminating with the birth of our nation.",5,1

9058881,More gravy than the grave about this movie,"I am not familiar with these types of films, so going in did not know what to expect. The movie sets up a supernatural situation fast, and you think that the boy has gone evil in the afterlife and is out to get the woman who is isolated physically, mentally, and isolated from her husband. Yep, creepy cabin, no one to hear her scream, and some lazy-eyed crazy-cat-woman psychic who talks to the dead warns her of ghosts following her around.But, the movie (for me and other people without an Associate Arts Degree in Film Critiqueing) has some twists and turns that keep you guessing, including some local village people who give off a Hotel California vibe, which all adds up to an intriguing movie with an ending that you probably won't expect. Got to say, I liked it alot and there were a few instances where I was hiding my eyes behind my hand 'cause just knew it was about to get freaky.",4,1

8640121,"Classical tragedy, with stunning music, choreography, and costuming","Although this is a riff on ""Romeo and Juliet"", it's more a classical tragedy- to my mind- than that is.The hallmark of a classical tragedy, I think, is how inevitable the ending-in-tears is. R&J; by that definition, seems more arbitrary, and has at least as much to do with bad teen-aged choices as classic inevitable woe.WSS, though- that's really inevitable, both because of the set-up and how people react to events. For me, that makes it more heartbreaking.I think it is additionally tragic that I can think of a whole number of societies in which this could be set, here and now; I would have hoped that we'd all have become more open-minded and tolerant... but we have not.Highly recommended- both for great music and dance, and also if you want to think.",5,1

2328187,A beautifully written book,"I must agree with others who have written reviews here praising this book, and I will not try to outdo their views, but I want  to add that I learned so very much from this book.  It is a book that is written with facts and empathy.  Mr. Solomon is a beautiful writer who manages the difficult task of giving us readers the unbiased information we need to know while bringing in the voices of the individuals who are willing to share their lives with us.  If you are interested in reading this book, then by all means do not hesitate any longer, you will not regret it.  Bravo, Mr. Solomon.",5,1

I understand his anger - I work with immigrants and see racism all the time, at all levels of society - but answering racism with name-calling may not be the best way to solve the problem.  Never mind, though. The author's is a voice that is seldom heard in this country and he's probably right that he needs to shout in order to get everyone's attention; I wish more Asians would demand to be heard.  (Note the semicolon.) And yes, they should ""get lucky"" in films too.  A funny yet serious read that will (or should) make you think.",4,1

This film has some funny parts, but mostly I was touched and actually teared up in many parts.  I'm glad I finally got to see it and would recommend this to anyone!",4,1

However, if you have experienced unfathomable pain, you will find a detailed plan of escape - forgiveness.  This isn't a kumbaya book.  Real tragedy can only be redeemed through the hard restorative work of forgiveness.  The hard work of forgiveness is impossible without an infusion from the Holy Spirit.If you need to forgive someone, you need to read this book.

""Disposition"" is reminiscent of Sabbath's ""Planet Caravan"" and ""Reflection"", a reworking of King Crimson's ""The Sheltering Sky"", goes on for much too long and never really takes off. ""Triad"" is superfluous, re-using the main riff of the title track and mixing in parts from several Led Zeppelin tunes (middle-section of ""Whole Lotta Love"", the Indian-like chants of ""Immigrant Song"")",4,1

What I found was an non-stop endless focus on the dangers of diving, some fascinating insight in to what drove these men to undertake such a dangerous adventure and page afer mind-numbing page of boring background details on the key players. Unfortunately,that makes for extremely slow reading, with little sizzle to keep the reader focused on the book. That also led to 356 pages (in my paperback version) that desperately need editing to keep the pace flowing. At times I was left wondering if the author was getting paid by the word.",1,0

The weight of the tripod is much heavier than the aluminum bargain from Wal Mart that I have, but that one let my camera get blown around by ocean breezes too, so the heft of this tripod will be better for long steady shots.  The feet having the ability to change from floor pads to landscape spikes quickly and easy are a nice feature.  The legs pop into the standard tripod position in an instant and with the press of a button they adjust outward which is a feature my bargain tripod did not have.Anyone thinking they could get the same quality for a better deal at a big-box store has not shopped for them there or doesn't care about the very nice features of this tripod.",5,1

It's an IKEA kitchen with limited space. And we are not there all the time so I just needed one good set of something to do cooking or baking. This was a good choice. I read a lot of bad reviews on previous models (7 piece/ 8 piece) so I waited till this one became available.The sieve that was in the previous model was plastic and flimsy. This one is make of metal mesh so it's a lot sturdier.The skid-proof on the bottom of the bowl was good, too.When we made pancake breakfast, it worked out perfectly.I don't think it's for rough usage.I love it when I can click everything into one tidy package.",5,1

Michael, the only halfway stable and decent family member resigns himself to holding together the family after the untimely incarceration of George Bluth, Sr. Jason Bateman portrays Michael's deer in headlights panic perfectly. Gob is my favorite character. He is hands-down the most pathetic of all the family members, and his chicken impression always leaves me in stitches. I would advise that you watch this with no distractions :the rapid-fire jokes in this show are also visual! I think that is why the show did not capture the ratings it needed to return for more seasons - you have to be quick to enjoy this one.",5,1

There is a sequel though, so maybe explanations are in there. I just might have to pick it up sometime.",2,0

926670,Another funny bok from Carl Hiaasen,"Star Island involves the escapades of a Britney/Lindsey type ""singer"" named Cherry Pie, who, through the magic of studio computers, takes a mediocre voice and makes it sound great.  She and the sycophants who surround her, think she is wonderful, but the dream may be coming to an end as Cherry Pie cannot seem to stay sober and has a big tour coming up that is make or break.To that end, a look-a-like named Ann is hired to show up at events Cherry can't, stay long enough to have her photo taken, and then go back behind the shadows.  Ann gets involved with our old riend Stink, who wants to save her from a photographer who has discovered her true identity.As usual with Hiaasen, several color characters are involved in her manager's attempts to keep her sober long enough to make it to the shows.  One of my favorites employs a cattle prod everytime she says ""like"" in a sentence, which is. like. every other word.  Not great literature, but definitely a fun, enjoyable read.",4,1
860300,The personality you project,"Set aside your personal political affiliation and views.  I think more people would like the book if it revolved around some other terrorist act in another part of the world (rather than 9/11), some other conflict than this one that is so fresh on our minds.The Reluctant Fundamentalist is a good story.  If you focus on the relationships the main character has, the delivery style, and the substory that is happening in the ""now"", you will enjoy it.  Hamid presents an interesting study on human behavior/sensibility and the pulls of nationalism and its duties.  At one level, the characters act all the same, but for each their personal histories bubble to the surface and take their lives in wildly different directions.  As others have said, the main character isn't so much reluctant as he is surprised by his own feelings.",5,1

No doubt it will hold the attention of even the most defiant of first readers.  Kudos to you, Patricia, for taking me back into the misunderstood days of my youth!",5,1
7145105,Excellent fast drives,"These drives are fast and relatively inexpensive.  I have three of these drives internal to my main desktop system and one inside my wife's desktop system.  In addition, we use two of them externally for backups (you'll need to find an appropriate case and power supply, mine is a kludge made from an old PC).  Or, you can get a &#34;Seagate Backup Plus&#34; which solves the external case problem for you.The drives have been very reliable.  I have experienced one drive failure in three years, and that one shipped with my desktop.  It failed within a month of being placed in service.  I attribute the failure to possible rough handling during shipping of the system unit.  None of the replacement drives that I've purchased individually have failed, they all came well packaged in sturdy boxes with lots of packing.Do be sure to get the 6Gb/s SATA cables for this drive.  If you use the slower cables, you may have performance problems and/or data errors.",4,1

3147015,Guide for brief stays or drive through,"This guide is ideally suited to those on driving vacations or brief stay near one of the many national parks in the western states.Each chapter is broken into sections: introduction to the park, when to visit, how to get there, park essentials, scenic drives, what to see, sports and outdoors, what's nearby, nearby attractions, where to eat and where to stay. Each chapter has color pictures and a map of the park with highlights and highways/roads. Chapter sizes range from a few pages to many depending upon the size/features of the park in question.I found the information for the parks I have visited to be reasonably accurate with my memories. I was a little disappointed in the number of pictures based upon experiences with other travel guides, but I can see using this guide while traveling near a park and wanting to make a short excursion (I'll take my own pictures &lt;g>). Those planning on extended visits to a park would be better advised to pick up a dedicated guide to the individual park. P-)",4,1

The world-building is truly innovative.

Set after WWII, the innocence and social rules are fascinating, making me nostalgic but also grateful to this generation of women who paved the way for us to have less rules. The characters are well-rounded, imperfect, if not sometimes scandalous, and kept me coming back to learn more about them. Overall, a great show. I'm looking forward to the upcoming season.",4,1

It's design and materials have a quality feel. I still use the veggie bags to keep it clean and to freeze my compost before taking it to the composter outside. I really like that the lid hangs on the side while I'm using it open. The size for me is perfect. I get 3 or 4 days before having to empty. I would buy another and I definitely recommend this product.6 months later - I see small signs of rust on the bottom inside, even though I use a plastic produce bags to line it.",5,1
1391736,A Perfect Match,"Felicia, a brilliant young woman, was turned over to a college by her parents at the age of four due to her extremely high intelligence.  She never lived with a family and failed to develop social skills.  After serving in logistics for Special Ops troops, she arrives in Fool's Gold determined to normalize her life as she desires a family.  Gideon spent two years as a captive of the Taliban while serving in Special Ops.  He feels like he is so damaged that he can never make a commitment to a woman.  Chemistry sparks and these two are set ablaze while Gideon remains determined to be emotionally uncommitted until a catalyst for change arrives in Fool's Gold.  So humorous to watch Felicity converse and develop socially.  I loved seeing the main characters find a way to make the town of Fool's Gold home.",5,1

It has a story or history behind it that many of us will never know. It's painful, like life at times. In the end, however, we have to look at ""Timothy as part of the whole picture of what Da Da has given us musically. The harmonies, phenomenal guitar work, which includes the bassline that drives many songs. What these three musician's have done on each of their albums is show a progression in their own style as well as pay homage (conscienciously or subunconsciously) to several musicians they may have drawn inspiration from. I'm 46 years old and I feel that these guys are carrying on the tradition of good old American Rock and Roll. BUT FOR THREE GUYS TO PUT OUT THE SOUND, MUSICALLY AND LYRICALLY, THEY DO IS MIRACULOUS, NOT TO MENTION ENJOYABLE!!!!!!Look out for ""El Subliminoso."" The evolution continues!",5,1
8083693,Good romance,You want to read this 3rd after the 1st books in the series so you know who the characters are.  I really like the girl in this book.

Good steamy parts with Zach also.,4,1
2634090,A find!,"In the biography department, this probably won't do the trick unless your child has a *very lenient* teacher.But in the imagination department, this book will blow you away.Bimba Landmann illustrated this book with found-object collages that DO NOT duplicate Chagall's work, but still manage to evoke that Chagall quality.  That other-worldliness.  That life-is-beautiful-and-surprising character of Chagall's art.  Her illustrations are exactly right for this book.The text is good -- especially if you are looking to relate this book to a child who seems to try a lot of things without finding something that ""clicks"" for them.  The book does a great job of describing how Chagall was surprised by his success and popularity.  And it also discusses war and the dread and sorrow of it.Lovely.",5,1

I was worried that the muffins would taste or smell like silicone, but they don't at all.

1094631,Disappointing,"What started as a great premise deteriorated into an implausible mystery. I was really hooked during the first part of the book. It focused on how the media and the legal system conspire to put people doing the right thing at risk for lawsuits and how there are no accidents in the courtroom.

It's well designed, well made, and sits unobtrusively out of the way holding, in my case, my Time Machine drive.  I haven't noticed any scratches, but I'm not worried about them, either.",5,1

It fits the screen (and sensors on the top-portion of the screen) perfectly, and it feels great to touch (it's not sticky or anything).The genius of this product is in the applicator.The protector comes sandwiched between two protector-protectors. This makes applying the protector cleaner, in the sense that it's basically impossible for stray hairs/dust/whatever to get onto your screen before you can apply the product. I've wasted many protectors in the past by applying them and then realizing a piece of dust got caught underneath, because once you lift it back up, it's impossible to clean and reapply.Bottom line is if you're looking for a screen protector for your S4, this is what you want. It's a great product, and it comes with 3 protectors, making this an unbeatable value.",5,1

As for the teapot, on the other hand, I was glad that I got it for free since it probably worth just that much. It feels cheaply made.

936536,Interesting at times,"I purchased this book for my niece, but decided to read it before I gave it to her. The story is about a 17-year-old girl named Bella, who falls madly in love with a vampire named Edward.Overall, I wish the story would have been more developed.  I think it focuses too much on the sexual attraction between Bella and Edward, and is  a bit outrageous with the lengths Bella will go to because of her love for him.  I gave it two stars, because at times it is an interesting read.  I've decided to hold on to this book until my niece is a bit older.  I think the sexual overtones in this relationship is for an older teen.  I found their relationship to be a bit dysfunctional.  I thought Edward was condescending and almost on the verge of being emotionally abusive.  The author never relates that Bella's blind devotion may come from the supernatural powers a vampire may have over a human.  The reader is led to believe that Bella's crazy behavior is because of true love.  I did not like that message.",2,0

1131039,Yuck,"This is possibly one of the worst books I've ever read.  It's a cheap knock off of the Twilight style or writing that's become so popular lately, but unlike Stephanie Meyer's books it falls sadly flat.  The writing is inconsistent and in places almost seems forced.  The main character spends too much time debating her humanity (or lack thereof).  One paragraph tells the reader that she did X because of her human side and a handful of pages later saying she doesn't have a human side so she doesn't understand Y.I wasn't able to finish the whole book.  I'm sorry I spent as much time on it as I did.  I think I tend to be a bit harsh on these reviews, but this one gets a definite Blech! =P~~ from me.",1,0

The convenience factor of leaving the bulky lock cable on you normal workplace and taking the smaller one home or to meetings is really good (which is essentially the purpose of the product).",4,1

The special feature disc is loaded with documentary material and deleted scenes.  Nevertheless, some of the acting is pretty bad (Jake Lloyd in particular), and the dialog is lame in spots.  Certainly these were gripes I had about the theatrical version, and I still went to see it twice!  The extra footage added to the DVD version does make it noticeably better.  I just hope George and the gang make an effort to rein in the more maudlin elements in Episode 2.In my mind, the best &quot;Star Wars&quot; episode overall is &quot;The Empire Strikes Back (aka Episode V)&quot;, displaying excellent acting, visuals, and plot.  The cornball stuff took a back seat; it would be great to see at least one of the first three episodes come close to it.",4,1

8630309,A Solid Eastwood Vehicle,"Though it gets lost in the ""Dirty Harry"" shuffle, ""The Gauntlet"" (1977) is an underrated action drama with more emphasis on characterization than bullets. In a change-of-pace role, Clint Eastwood plays a down-and-out Phoenix cop who faces seemingly impossible odds - and endless corruption - when he is assigned to escort a Las Vegas prostitute (Sondra Locke) to trial. Needless to say, Clint's slimy boss (William Prince) wants to make sure he doesn't get the job done. Stylishly directed by Eastwood, the film moves at a fast clip and benefits from strong performances. Interestingly, Eastwood's character fires his gun only twice and never kills anyone. The elaborate climax is a bit ludicrous (why don't the Phoenix officers shoot out the bus tires?), yet ""The Gauntlet"" remains on-target most of the way. A must-see for Eastwood fans.",4,1

There were just some lapses that bothered meto the point where it ruined the story namely-How is Theodosia was able to survive the horrid Roman prison for so many years with literallya broken body when other 'hale and hearty' men did not?At the end when Otho is chasing her in the rain and dark she gets away; what happens to him?He is left cursing and riding in the rain.Some of the 'solutions'  to her many problems seemed a bit too easy and the ending well itwas an ending.",4,1

Gut-wrenching laughter, not a tee-hee.  Laughter that brought tears to my eyes.  Having said that, I cannot believe there are a couple of negative reviews.  My first response is ""are they living on this planet"" - who could lack such a sense of humor, empathy and love for this dog after reading this book.  The author was brilliant in his descriptions of Marley's subnormal condition (as Evelyn Woodhouse may have described him).

In truth it is basically a story of survival and commiment to others and what is learned along the path when your world or the world you know is taken away from you.A terrific thriller than doesn't rely on special effects but on the directions of its creators and the acting of its cast.",5,1

I'm a new trader and I wanted to get a feel for what trading is all about. By page 26 I learned more than I ever expected about how and why we are lied to all the time in the media by the experts, which I always suspected but never could exactly figure out. The whole last part of the book had myth after myth debunked about trading, the markets, and investing. This is stuff I've been hearing my whole life, and guess what---most of it is dead wrong. This explains why so many people lose on such a consistent basis. There were a few annoying typos here and there, like EFT instead of ETF, and I wish the book was a little longer and got into more specifics and tools, but overall, quite a lot of info, very condensed and very good, by someone who at least comes off like a real trader who has been there. Pretty hard to go wrong for 10 bucks in my opinion.",5,1

2029913,The Mark of RAN... a great beginning!,"An enticing fantasy/adventure by Paul Kearney.When I started to read this book I had some initial concerns that it may have been meant for an adolescent audience; such is not the case. Although the story seems to begin rather tamely, the main character (Rol) quickly becomes engrossed in a story of travel, intrigue and combat; then add to this some sexual innuendos, betrayals and a liberal dose of magic, and you have just about everything anyone could want in a good adult fantasy novel.The quality of writing is good, however it is the story line, with its many twists and surprises, that really make this book hard to put down.All in all, a excellent start to (hopefully) a ongoing series of entertaining novels. The second book is coming out soon and I'm looking forward to being able to continue to follow the story of Rol. 5 Stars.",5,1

5888990,Current Favorite,"Even though I've listened to this since it came out, I never tire of it.  The Piano Concerto is truly a wonderful work, both ""masterpiece"" and joke, and why not?  Well, maybe not a joke; though, if you listen carefully, you're bound to chuckle at some point.  Beethoven, the classical composer Ligeti reminds me most of, had a sense of humor combined with a taste for complexity also.In fact, I feel as though I am hearing quotations of Beethoven in the cadenza right near the end of the Concerto, but I just can't place them.The rest of the disc is just as good.  These pieces have all been recorded before; even though ""Mysteries of the Macabre"" is a orchestral premiere, I've got a Roland Pontinen/Hakan Hardenberger version for piano/trumpet I might prefer.  But the other performances are the best I've ever heard of these works.  Well-recorded too.",5,1
2326285,An entertaining read,"This is a perfect rainy Sunday afternoon read. It is a concise, crisp, well written chronicle of George Washington and his troops with enough background and ancillary information to keep it in the context of the times.

2597631,"Cute, but lacked a little pazzazz!","The story is about Scarlett, as she opens her bakery, deals with crazy family members, her best friend's wedding and her on-going struggle with self esteem.  Add in some romantic tension as two men vie for Scarlett's attention:  the hunky bad boy or the geeky dependable friend.My take:  great plot, loved the characters, loved Scarlett, well written...  However, the book lacked that spark; there were no re-read parts (the parts that were so good you just have to go back and read them again!).  This is a cute sequel to the first book in this series but wasn't as exciting ad the first.  I would recommend reading it if you've been following this series.  If you haven't read the series, it will be terribly boring to pick it up here!",4,1

Even though I don't share a background with any of the characters, I really cared about and empathized with the people in this book. I was so anxious to find out what happened that I stayed up too late three nights in a row to finish the story.

It worked fine in single-user, no encryption mode but that is not what I needed. I experienced severe problems trying to use it in single user mode with WEP or in multi-user mode with and without WEP. One or both laptops would lose the ability to connect to the internet at seemingly random intervals. Sometimes cycling the laptop wireless radio would restablish the connection, sometimes I had to reboot the laptops, sometimes I had to reboot the WGR101, and sometimes I had to reboot the laptops and the WGR101. Stay away from this product unless single user, unencrypted access is what you need.",1,0

It was  hard to decide on a favorite but I did it. Did You Like? I recited it to a  friend on Valentine's Day and well, let's just say I think I'm in there!  The appearance of the book is impressive in itself. The satin bookmark, the  elegant calling card, the rose petals ! OH MY GOD...maybe that was a  secret. oopps! I wish I had space to share all of my feelings about this  book but I don't. I can only make a suggestion, BUY THE BOOK !",5,1
583045,Great Book,"If you love art, you will want to read about the greatest heist of the century.  The crime remains unsolved, so you will not have closure, but you will find this book interesting.

If you look at any of the other reviews that go into great detail about all of the reasons this book is nothing but awful, then you'll know how I feel and why I gave it one star.  I would have given it less, if Amazon allowed me, like maybe one point on one star, but alas, one was the worst I could give it.  Read it if you must, but remember, you were warned.",1,0

However, to date, I've read this one at least four times.  I love it and cannot wait for the next installment.  The characters work together brilliantly, captivating the reader from the start.  I love Vlad as the romantic hero and the dynamic between himself and the heroine is nearly perfect.  Somehow, Frost makes Vlad's nonchalant arrogance appealing.  However, I predict he gets some sort of comeuppance in next book.  This is my favorite book in the whole Cat and Bones series and break out series - and I've read them all.",5,1
5594342,Worth your time,"I won a copy and promised a review in exchange. This is the first book I have read by this author, but it won't be the last. I wished this had been a little longer because it felt a little rushed. Aside from that it was a great read. I loved the h and her smarta** attitude. It kept me captivated from the start and at no time was I bored by it. I finished it in one setting and was surprised by who the bad guy ended up as. There was even a point where one of the Hero's let me down and I was cussing at my Kindle. I think you will enjoy it!",5,1

He was perfecly cast and delivers great dialogue.  His final fight with Cruise was thrilling and even brought a standing ovation from some in the audience.  The editing and pacing of the film was also perfect-I never felt bored or overloaded with action.  Cruise was good as usual and if you can overlook his kookiness you will enjoy this movie.",4,1

McLaughlin and his crew are heroes, and are not written, but burned, into the great book of jazz in the heavens.",5,1
5711970,This album just never gets old!,"I'll reiterate what every music critic has mentioned: the sound on this recording is stellar, the vocal harmonies between the three leads are extraordinary, the songwriting is outstanding, etc.  What makes me spin this CD more often than most is the fact that the lyrics are also incredibly personal and touch on subject matter that is universal and emotionally resonant.  There are the obvious hits which include ""Dreams,"" ""Don't Stop,"" and ""Go Your Own Way.""  Then there are other songs here that reach epic standards like ""The Chain"" and ""Gold Dust Woman.""  To top it all off there are some fun tracks like ""Second Hand News"" and ""I Don't Want To Know.""  This album has achieved iconic status representing some of the finest music ever to come out of the seventies.  Be that as it is, the music still sounds fresh and vibrant today as when it was first released.  Front to back, this is an essential album for any collection.  Highly recommended.",5,1

Chosen after passing all the exhaustive tests of the Intergalactic Matchmaking Services, Maggie refuses to even visit the Alien spaceship without her beloved pet Siamese cat. She is a very responsible pet owner and loves Mamszell too deeply to turn her over to a another as a convenience. This is a light hearted (somewhat short) story of love developing between a human girl and a Alien man (Daxon) who wanted no part in the experience of match making.Maggie is on the run after witnessing a murder by the leader of a gang. Her attempt to leave town for a few weeks turns into instant, almost love at first sight with Security Chief Daxon. This is a sweet (not full of erotic sexual scenes) story every pet owner or not should love to read. The scenes between the Aliens meeting a demanding Siamese cat are genuinely hilarious!

This one juxtaposes chapters describing the plot with chapters focused on the bios of individual victims, a technique that, I think, makes the tragedy more vivid than massing victims in to a big number.  I learned a few new things about the plot, a lot of new things about some of the heroism of the victims and the minutes before the collapse.  In contrast to the previous reviewer, I did not think the approach was clinical; if anything, I thought the writing was a big overwrought in places.

That is, until it goes bonkers at the end ... a nice manipulation technique by the director. Eihi Shiina's range of performance from ideal femininity to psycho-killer is fabulous and accounts for a sizable chunk of the shock we experience at the end of the film.

1908544,The world needs more &quot;Dartmouth Reviews&quot;,"In its stated purpose of &quot;mentoring&quot; college-aged, or younger, conservatives, this book does a fine job in introducing its target audience to many of the distinctive elements of traditional conservative thought. It's not a perfect book, and maybe someday I'll write a column somewhere about how D'Souza fundamentally mis-states the libertarian philosophy, and libertarian beliefs on some key issues. In that section, at least, he does his young friend &quot;Chris&quot; a real disservice. It's only because that's such a relatively small part of the book that I'm not downgrading my ranking more.But apart from that (and the author's annoying idolatry -- it's not too strong a word -- of Lincoln), there is much here to learn from and enjoy. If campus conservatives can arm themselves with the information -- and also the techniques -- D'Souza passes along here, the political atmosphere of our colleges will be much improved, and much more entertaining.",4,1

Don't be fooled by her name --- Oriah is a real person living in the real world, with a goal of being the best person she can be. And this book is an honest, intimate sharing of her efforts --- triumphs and failings included.I find it interesting that the negative reviews of The Invitation are written with what seems to me to be so much anger, fear and even hatred. These reviewers frequently site their fears of Oriah's misguided values, but they have no problem investing their energy into going beyond reviewing a book to personally attacking a person they have never met.",5,1

6684365,Excellent cable,"Excellent cable except for one thing they don't tell you and isn't labeled on the cable, it's one way directional.  I only found this out after already fishing the cable behind the wall.  When I hooked it up the first time, it didn't work.  But an electrician buddy of mine told me to reverse it.  After unfishing, reversing the cable and refishing behind the wall, it worked.  Strange but it works great.",4,1
7702078,So far So good I recomend this for allergy sufferers,"This particular unit we have gets five stars. Unfortunately other units like this one I've owned gave up the ghost far too early.Why did I get another after having problems with them in the past? There are three reasons. First off I got a heck of a sale on my new one plus free shipping. Secondly and I guess most importantly is the fact that when these units do work they work very,very,well. Had they not worked well no sale would ever tempt me to buy another. THIRDLY I have allergies to dust and mold. The HEPA filter works very well on this vac and does even better if you use the special allergen filtration bags.To tell the truth the reason the other vacs did not last for me is the fact that my son treats them like super heavy duty, 4 wheel drive, all terrain, goes over any obstacle vacuum cleaners.Will my new one last?? Only time will tell.",5,1
4506864,Great autobiography of a Russian woman fighter pilot,"I am not a fan of war stories, but this autobiography is a great perspective of how it was to live in Russia at the time of the German invasion.  While Anna is like her male counterparts in many ways, her story includes great details of what people dressed like, the jokes they made, and the hard work that the mechanics, fighter pilots and others did to save their country.",4,1

1999093,Shapiro's best.,"Let me say before I begin my review of this particular collection, Alan Shapiro is one of my favorite poets.  His collections are always wonderfully cohesive... not ALWAYS themed, but there seems to be a nice thread running through each one.  This one is the grittiest, most real (to me), and I think it contains so many wonderful poems which would be accessible even to those who might find poetry obscure or intimidating.  This book becomes my new Shapiro favorite, right behind the wonderful previous release ""Old War: Poems.""  Love this book.  FIVE hearty stars.",5,1

2723920,THE BEST BOOK YET!,"Oh my goodness! -- I was not able to put ""Crossfire"" down once I began reading it! I have to say that hands down Jeanette Windle is the best Christian author I have  discovered. She thoroughly researches her material and writes in such a way as to keep the reader on the end of his/her seat. It is easy to see why her books are rated so highly. I hope she just keeps writing them because I will haunt the list to read every one sent to print. To anyone looking for a better-than-good read, GET THIS BOOK!",5,1
8156674,Heartaches are sometimes good.,"This story hit a nerve for me. My dad was an alcoholic and so the journey Jimmy had to go on made me realize how hard it must have been for my dad. Anyway, I liked that Eddie wanted to fix Jimmy and at first felt he went about it the wrong way. However, as the story progressed, I could see the love Eddie had for Jimmy, even with the 'intermix' of Dan. I did not care for Dan at first. He was too pushy and was still pushy even though he knew that Eddie was in love with Jimmy. Good back story on both men. You could see Jimmy's growth and understanding of himself and his issues. I loved this story and the fact that the men had their HEA.  Dan needs his own story and it does not need to include Eddie and Jimmy.",5,1
3325269,Homicide Detective's Method Of Proving Christianity,"J. Warner Wallace does an outstanding job of using his skills as a L.A. homicide detective (who has solved many cold cases) to look at the case for Christianity.  By examining numerous eye witness accounts of the events, he looks for inconsistencies in their stories to disprove the truth of Christianity only to find that all the accounts are amazingly consistent and he can't crack the case.  It must be true.The first section of the book teaches you how to be a detective and applies those principles to the case for Christianity.  The second section helps you examine the evidence using a series of questions that good detectives use.  The third section is the appendix and gives credit to the expert witnesses that were used, the assisting officers and the case notes and supporting evidence.All in all, a fun and fresh way to examine the case for Christianity in a relevant way for today.",5,1
3620644,Amazing Truth,"Even though this book is fiction the truth was told on so many topics, especially loving a Black Queen. Once people Realize it's not about the color over you but content of what is in you, we as a people will be bettter. This read was FAN~TAS~TEAK!

4816272,Team Lucas,"I usually don't write reviews as although I love to read I am not a very good wordsmith but LIF is worth the effort.Ms Hanson brings us into the paranormal world lead by the sizzling hot Lucas, who's goal is to bag our heroin Val, weather it is for love or for.... other purposes. Val is torn between her attraction to Lucas and her ties to Jack, our favourite Vampire hunter, and that is only the tip of the iceberg. Enter ""the fey"" and the real fun begins.This book has action, suspence,romance and passion that is beautifully weaved into an original storyline (which is hard to come by if you are an avid reader of anything supernatural)that leaves you craving for more.Be prepared for book you will not put down once you have begun and will struggle to part with once it is finished.",5,1

2179803,Good reading,"This was a little hard for me to get into, but it was another book chosen by our book club.  I am glad I persevered as it was an excellently written story.

2476109,Very handy,"You are going to find this a handy book.  We all enjoy being able to put together great tasting recipes in a jiffy.  You will be able to do that with this.  My favorite part of this book is that many of our Bisquick favorites are no longer on the back of cards, boxes, but right there ready to go.  This book has a wide variety of recipes, definately more than I thought possible for Bisquick.  You are going to find this book helpful when your in search of something quick to put together for dinner.",5,1

2367321,The Southwestern Homesteaders,"A friend handed me this book when I told her that my grandmother raised my mom and her six siblings in the Panhandle of Texas, widowed, facing the depression years and, even worse, the Dust Bowl.  So I found the setting amazingly true, and the story of Lilly a heroic description of one woman's thriving through flood, storm, 500-mile horse rides, teaching, being displaced, betrayed and alone in Chicago, searching for work, time and again.  The narrative is so brilliantly detailed that I can imagine being there, walking through Santa Fe, running a ranch, living on a mesa!  Thank you for this story, Jeannette Walls, for sharing this memory of your grandmother.",5,1

4706603,So many parallels,"Having recently lost my mother, I found this book comforting.  My brothers and I went thru many similar circumstances with the cleaning out, selling and disposing of the treasured items accumulated in her home of 56 years.  The decisions not to want things that meant so much to another is a difficult process. Redistributing or disposing of drawers of pictures, school projects and newspaper clippings becomes a daunting task, not to mention the knick/knacks, clothes, etc.  The author approached this with clarity, dignity and humor.  I really enjoyed it and may even read it again.",5,1
4779353,Beautifully Written Paranormal Dystopia,"This beautifully written paranormal dystopia is a book that captures you and doesn't let go. It is a fast paced read about powerful but peaceful Guardians who only want to protect the world and help those who have forgotten that they too are Guardians.The story is mainly about a girl named Sidney Davenpport. When she was young it was prophesized that she would help the earth from those who were bent on leading it into darkness. She is gifted and a bit wild, which is why her mentor calls her Wildchild.She and her brother, Danik, are asked to break into a military based to retrieve some information. While doing this she is caught and is ordered to be executed. She is sent to the USS Nonnah where she meets ad eventually falls in love with the captain, Samaru Waterhouse.The Guardian's Wildchild is filled with New Age thoughts and wisdom. It has a bit of a surprising ending to it that I will admit bothered me somewhat. Overall I really enjoyed this book and the journey it took me on.",4,1
6950930,Perfect for compact Backup,"I have now bought 2 sets of these to keep one with each of my laptops and I couldn't be happier. These take next to no space but allow me to sync and charge everything I own. Finally, if you need longer cables you can simply carry one USB 2.0 extension cable and use it with whatever cable you are using at the time.Pros:- Tiny- Appropriately flexible: not as flexible as a normal cable, but not completely rigid either- Complete: syncs/ charges nearly every modern device that exists - iphone, android phone, ipad, kindle, hard drive, etc.- Heavy Duty: these should outlast any of my regular cablesCons:- Short (for obvious reasons)- USB 2.0 (adequate, but not future proof)Conclusion:I can't think of a better solution to have every cable I could possibly need in such a small package. I highly recommend these to anyone who travels, or even just transports a laptop to and from work or school and wants to be prepared.",5,1

4693718,Evolution of Insanity,"This author has a wonderful way of making you think about, and observe, your world around you. I felt like I was in Chicago, and though I have only spent a few months there, I have watched a lot of thses types of antics go on around me. If we could slow our world down, and really pay attention, what would we see?And would the seeing bring us closer to understanding? Or would it bring us closer to our own insanity--and there is where you find, The Evolution of Insanity.I have not enjoyed reading something so much in my life. I believe we'll be listening to Heresh Daswani on great talk shows, like Chicago on NPR, showing his delightful insights, for many years to come.I easily gave this book 5 stars",5,1
7810348,Picky Fussy Buyer,"The bottom of the bowls are 'recessed' so if you wash them face down in the dishwasher, you're left with 'standing' water which has to be shaken-off or wiped dry.

I would not have bought them if I had known this though.",4,1
2147750,5 star review,"I truly love this series. The love every single emotion that flows through me as I read this series. I truly recommend this series. Yes, each book is short, but who cares. It is a great series and it adds to the mystery and excitement on whats going to happen next. Each book continues to get better and better. Love it...Kudos H.M. Ward!!!",5,1
884781,Clear consise reading,"This book explains the problem ignored by so many physicists. It makes a compelling argument that the universe depends on the observer and somehow the universe may not be real or fit into the reality people are used to thinking about. I'm not through the whole book yet and I'm sure I'll want to re-read it, but it has me questioning if we really exist and even if we do exist, that the universe is nothing like people think. I have reached the part about Bells Theorem and this is the nitty gritty of the book I think. Highly recommended since it treats not just the quantum physics realities but how we people are an integral part of the reality we encounter in quantum mechanics that makes you question what existance really is.",5,1
7133908,Flush fit,It fits perfectly and hasn't failed me. I use this in my early 2011 MBP. It's used to house my OEM 500gb hdd while I used a different 500gb as my main drive.,5,1

2186822,Disappointing in plot and presentation,"I had hoped this book would be done in alternating points of view from all four girls (like If There Be Thorns). Instead, Brooke is our narrator, and the reader is limited to her perceptions. The other three girls become  typecast by their personalities (the wimp, the brain, the troublemaker) and  we lose the intimacy we had with them in their books.  Also, I hope the  plot was meant to show that runaways are on a one-way street to nowhere,  because that's how I felt while reading it. Not the thrilling finale I was  hoping for.",2,0
9412104,Probably it is a cultural thing but,it was terribleee slow movie and without any sense for me. THere is not moral to the story and I didn't understand the point of the story. The scenes were so naive that it was laughable. But It is true that I watched in 3 times and I skipped a lot of the scenes so may be there is some plot. The way the actors behave it is as they are in the 19 century of before but I guess that is the way Korean behave in normal life.,2,0
5796400,"What can I say, it's HEART",Some of HEART's best music.  They are never a disappointment.  But then I am their biggest fan.  I just hope Anne and Nancy remember the scorpion on the stage .........and that I stomped it flat for them.,5,1
3340814,Another great Cindy Gerard book,"I have missed Cindy Gerard.  I devoured the entire bodyguard series and the first Black Ops books, so was thrilled when this new book came out.  I found the story compelling and the right blend of action and romance.  I liked the flashbacks, but would have liked a bit more to really buy that Wyatt had been pining for Sophie all these years.  I think that Gerard made Wyatt a great, sexy and strong lead.  I enjoyed that most of the book was from Wyatt's point of view. I love that her female characters have strength and backbone.  The action level was high, exciting and yet believable enough.  We got to spend time with all of our favorite BOIs.  I would have liked to have a few gaps filled in and wished that it hadnt been so easy to guess the bad guy, but still a very enjoyable read.",4,1
8434665,Echo is amazing!,I absolutely loved this book! Echo is an amazing character with so much to offer. Pair her up with Hawke and they are unstoppable! This is a one of a kind book that will keep you fully entertained and wanting more!,5,1
5094232,Loved it!,"I put this book aside as a ""maybe"" to read awhile ago.  Yesterday I had a few hours to read and once I started I couldn't put it down (in fact I was up at 5am this morning to finish it).  I had to know whether the main character, Kelli,  would make it back to her 25 year old self having fast forwarded to her 50th birthday and what repercussions her visit in the future would have.  I grew to love Kelli more and more as the book progressed and she discovered another side to herself, let go of the superficial and embraced a warm and loving experience.  A very clever concept with some wonderful new technology to be introduced to as we move 25 years ahead, the author might want to patent some of these ideas, just incase!  Highly recommend Fast Forward and look forward to reading more books by Juliet Madison.",5,1
3775217,First book I've loved in a long time!,I was not expecting something so thrilling! This book was a real page turner and was excited to see what would happen next! The characters were so real life it was hard to believe it didn't actually happen. The ending was so wonderful I actually read it twice to make sure I had read it right. You have to really pay attention to this book to love it as much as I did. It really was an amazing read!,5,1

I mean, we were all there at one point in our lives, but I don't care to revisit it without a really good reason.  This book doesn't have any reason, much less one that is good enough.",2,0
3186946,Awesome version of the Physical Law of Attraction!!!,"You know how you can meet someone for the first time and forever be stuck with the first impression of either liking them or hating them. This is the basic premise for the law of attraction which is the secret of manifestation. We are attracted to others 'people and things' and others are attracted to us that match our vibration. This vibration has been refered to by many names: feelings, aura, energy, intuition, etc. I believe Divine Matrix takes the law of attraction to the next step by manifesting it into the physical. It's an amazing concept to behold and I highly reccomend this book to anyone who is looking for the physical aspect of the law of attraction. The Divine Matrix takes on the mechanical aspects of the law of attraction. It is a more technical version than the others. If you are a sci-fi buff then I believe this book will work better for you than the others.",5,1

2360239,So helpful,"I'll be traveling to Russia and needed a very quick crash course in speaking the language.  I've learned other languages but this course, by far, is the easiest way to do so.  I've been teaching myself to read Russian but after listening to these CDs, I've realized I was really off on my pronunciations.  Not only have these CDs strengthened my speaking ability but they've made reading the language so much easier as well.  These CDs will definitely complement any studying you are doing of this language.  True, the CDs may initially seem repetitive and a tad boring but get past lesson one and you find that this really works Give it a chance and you will learn quite a bit in these sixteen lessons.",5,1

1492557,"Excellent read, even better than the movie","20% rocket science, 80% snapshot of a time and place called Coalwood West Virginia.  Homer Hickam&#8217;s biography perfectly illustrates one young man&#8217;s quest to escape the coal black future of his surroundings, earn his father&#8217;s respect and love, and find himself through the tumultuous years of adolescence.  From his first attempted rocket launch, which acted essentially as a pipe bomb destroying his mother&#8217;s fence, to the loss of his virginity Mr. Hickam does an excellent job of capturing the trials and tribulations of growing up and conveying them in a way that allows the reader to connect with the story and will leave you remembering your own coming of age.  If you enjoyed the movie &#8220;October Sky&#8221; you can rest assured that as is usually the case once again the book is much better than even that excellent film.",5,1
8081409,Super Rock,"In my opinion the Rock is up there with the greats of Wrestling, i.e Hulk Hogan and the Undertaker. Not only a great wrestler but also a great showman who brought excitement to the WWE. This is the perfect book for all WWE fans, and particularly fans of the Rock",5,1

I was pulled in right away and loved it. I have a strong feeling there will be more coming soon; this story is that good. I can easily see this becoming a series or trilogy. This has to be only the beginning of meeting Miranda, and I want to find out more about this world the author has created.A few months were skipped over in the middle of the story, which is the only reason I rated this four stars instead of five; however, this is a short story - not a novella nor a novel - and maybe those months weren't that essential to the overall story. I still would love to know what happened during that time, and I am definitely looking forward to more from this author!",4,1

9421968,"Olympus Has Fallen, the Redux","2013 spawned two movies about the takeover of the White House:Olympus Has Fallenand this, White House Down.I'm hard pressed to not compare the two.  Each has the White House compromised allowing unsavory characters access to the President of the United States.  Each has a somewhat washed out character who saves the day.  Olympus Has Fallen clocks in at 1:59 while White House Down comes in at 2:15.  Both have a black man as president at some point or another.I was entertained but not so much that I would like or need to see this (or the other) movie any time soon.",4,1

Knowing how Ms. Penny spins her tales, I set aside two nights to read this book and was not disappointed.Every character from Three Pines can make you laugh and cry and fall in love with them.  Those who work with Gamache are fortunate in having a superior who will never fail them.While this book does have its murder mystery, there is a bigger plot that continues from her last book and is a very dark tale of evil for the sake of power. The suspense was terrific.Louise Penny has won quite a few awards for Inspector Gamache and Three Pines, every one well deserved. How can anyone not love Gamache?",5,1

You can feel the ocean just off the porch. Go shopping with Maddy, help her decide how to decorate the inn. Get mad at Phil the cad. Wonder what kind of mischief Becky is up to. This book is wonderful and I can hardly wait for the next one in the series. Anyone that wants something easy and fun to read without sex scenes, this is for you.",5,1
3269242,Great Book,My kids love the pictures in this book.  Since they don't actually read yet they make up stories for the different pictures.  It has been a lot of fun.  The only downside is that this book is almost $20.00 and my kids are going trash in a matter of months since the pages are paper. (The book flap disappeared in the first hour).  If you have the disposable income for an item like this I think its a great one.,4,1

My border collie and Jack Russel send the same signals....tongue licking, soft eye, downward eye, turn away....I've seen them doing this to our cats...and now I'm very aware when we go hiking and encounter other dogs.  So very glad to have read this book.  I've read Cesar's books too....but this is far, far, far better!!  Took me on a whole different level of dog communication.

556695,A Masterful Mystery.,"Rei is from California. She's bright, independent, and wears unacceptable athletic shoes. Her Japanese aunt works hard at putting the finishing touches on her wayward niece, including lessons in flower arranging. As Rei  bows deeply and tries to follow the elaborate formal rituals of polite  society, she gets deeper and deeper in trouble: a corpse, an unacceptable  suitor, a philandering master teacher, and several attempted murders.  It's  the kind of wonderful setting in which the death threats are in haiku, the  flower shears are gruesome weapons, and any one of the oh-so-polite  Japanese has ample reason to have killed the victim. Rei is a thoroughly  likeable protagonist, the setting is evocative and finely drawn, and the  plot is filled with dark passion and unexpected twists and turns. I am  delighted with this book, and will read more novels by Sujata Massey.",5,1

After reading so many bad books from free downloads, I was skeptical about this one to say the least, with the peculiar title of the book and all. But as soon as I started reading, I started laughing out loud, which I usually don't do when reading, and kept laughing until the end of the book. It's a great satire, sweet, short and hilarious. Now that it's not free, I have gifted this book to several people and they all enjoyed it. Since I've read all three books by RJ Silver, I now read his blog religiously for more laugh while I anxiously wait for his next book.",5,1

Accardo blows everyone away with these performances; his fingerboard is on fire. Accardo is one of the best today, if not the best. The range, tone, dynamics, and profoundness of his violin is only rivaled by a few of the greats. These performances are as the master, Paganini, would have played them. They are some of the most dynamic displays of violin playing the world has ever experienced. They are definitely in a class of their own. Also, the recording is excellent; it's crystal clear with Accardo's violin capturing an unbelievable sound quality; such range-WOW!. I know why Beethoven only wrote one violin concerto; how can you compete against Niccolo.",5,1

Long buried love quickly rises to the surface and the two lovers pick up almost where they left off. Hannah is in for a bit of a surprise when Adam reveals he has a son, and they have to face the past to move forward.This really sweet story of long lost love recaptured grabbed my attention from the first page.

Quite a remarkable feat, if you ask me.  This novella proved a nice appetizer with promise of great things to come.  I can't wait to read the first in this novella.  I give this short prequel a flying 5 * review.",5,1

1554219,Fine book on shakespeare,This is one of the best books that I have ever read on William Shakespeare. Greenblatt uses the plays combined with the snippets we know from the bard's past to create an astonishing biography.Greenblatt is an entertaining writer who clearly knows the plays inside and out. He has drawn from extensive analysis of the text to create a complex and thoroughly convincing picture of the great writer. This is a great book and should be read by anyone with more than a passing interest in Shakespeare.I was particualry impressed with his chapter on Macbeth which drew up on its links to the Gun powder plot and beyond. He places Shakespeare as a man of his time whode writing transcended it.,5,1
1314639,A great tribute to a great horse,"I purchased my first horse in 1964 and I remember hearing all about Snowman so this story was particularly interesting for me.  Some parts were a bit repetitive and it would have been nice to perhaps have had a little more detail on the day to day lives of the owner and the horse, but it certainly brought back lots of memories and put a tear in my eye.  A very inspirational story.  I would recommend it.",4,1
797896,The Secret Life of Bees,This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  The setting is in South Carolina in the middle of the Civil Rights movement during the time when President Johnson signed the bill allowing black people to register for the vote. Life lessons learned during a young girl's growing up period gently handled by an unlikely source makes this novel stand out as great.  I would recommend this book to young and old alike.,5,1
9282619,QUITE INSIGHTFUL,"I do music photography. Unfortunately not for a living because nowadays everybody and their mother has a camera. Photographers are a dime a dozen.Guys like Robert and Mark Weiss are fortunate because they started doing this many years ago, way before there were so many restrictions on photographers.They got their foot in the door early and that's huge. Having early photos of Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and others is priceless. A fellow photographer told meabout Robert so I rented the DVD and I enjoyed it. You don't have to be a music photographer to enjoy this DVD but if you are you'll probably relate to a lotof what Robert talks about. I think it's great that he tries to help up and coming artists since he's got a lot of connections in the business. You canrent the DVD and check it out like I did before you buy it. I enjoyed it and I'm sure some of you will as well.[...]",4,1
7827105,Does what they are supposed to do,"When I reviewed everything Amazon had, I really wanted to purchase the cuter looking bags with the multi-colored tags. I'm just too darned practical because I bought these instead, double the number of bags for the same price as the cute ones. They are very light weight, very easy to see through/ scan through. They just are not cute or sexy. I'm okay with that. One reviewer complained that they are stiff, but I don't have any issues or regrets. They are made from recycled water bottles. They are very sturdy, and I am glad I purchased the large size- perfect/versital. I really enjoy using them, glad I bought them. The ten bags come packed in a small mesh bag with a string tie that is great for garlic, ginger, etc. (So you are really getting 11 bags.) The large size is perfect for apples, peppers, broccoli, kale, etc. String ties cinch close and pull open very easily.",5,1
8436487,Please don't judge me by my e-reader,I found this story to be a lot of fun to read.  I noticed some reviews complained about the characters being &#34;over the top&#34; but I think that's part of the reason I loved this story.  Maybe it's all those Star Trek reruns I watched in the 70's but I found the accidental interaction and the potential impact to be reminiscent of those episodes.  And goodness I can just imagine what some alien would be trying to come up with if they used the books on my Nook to come up with an idea of how to care for me.,4,1

And, my husband (from Turkey) says the recipes are really tasty, but they're adaptations of traditional recipes.

7967844,Enjoyable,"REVIEW CONTAINS A POSSIBLE SPOILERI really liked this one, sometimes I really want to read the story which puts the lovers and their friends against the world instead of all the breaking up and making up stuff. This one really delivers in this aspect, and I liked the friendship and comaradery of all the guys at the ranch.The only niggle I have is that when story tries to be a historical romance, I want more indication that it is actually a historical romance. Settings were barely sketched imo and no way I believed that so many people in the 19 century would be so very accepting of gay cowboys living nearby. I mean, there are people who are not accepting them of course, but as a whole atmosphere of the town is way too accepting in my opinion.But again, as costume historical it worked well for me.

The viewfinder tends to give impression that image is great when it enlarged too much and finished picture looks bad.  Great images can be made with it off.  If subject is too far away, reducing picture size will enlarge it (bring it in closer) and still give satisfactory sharpness and detail.Initially, I did not like the camera, but after getting it set properly it has become my favorite.

Douglas stars as a former big city car salesman who was at the top of his game....until unscrupulous business practices put an end to it all.  What remains is his seemingly insatiable appetite for very young women--no matter the cost.  And the cost is high, as his appetite seems to have a negative effect on practically every aspect of his personal life and relationships; from that with his daughter and grandson, to his own girlfriend.  And while a health scare may have exacerbated an already healthy appetite for the opposite sex, despite his bad behavior the protagonist is surrounded by a cast of people who have only his best interest in mind.

I wasn't expecting anything more than 90 minutes of escapist entertainment, and that's just what I got! This movie had some good scenes and some dumb ones, some cheap special effects, some bad lines and some silly sexual content. So did ""Return of the Jedi"", if you want to get technical. This isn't really even a horror movie. It's more like the old drive-in ""B"" movies that Elvira built her career on. I certainly wouldn't build a library out of movies of this quality, but there definitely is a certain amount of entertainment value. Consider this what it is, a well-done low budget movie, not a major studio blockbuster. Independent studio creativity doesn't always have to mean art films, after all!",4,1

As another reviewer mentioned, the strap does end up being at the bottom of the container, which seems a bit awkward.  However, you can rest assured knowing that the lid is tightly snapped in place.The case should also help keep your goodies insulated for up to 4 hours.

1003364,Fantasy for the non-fantasy reader,"My husband, an avid fantasy reader, has tried for years to get me interested in the genre.  One evening when I was desperate for something to read, he handed me this book and begged me to give it a chance.  I was hooked from page one!  The writing is exceptional, and the characters--especially the women--are well developed.  What strikes me most about Martin's work is that it is brutally honest and the characters act and think like real people...they don't seem at all like the stereotypical &quot;heroes&quot; I've encountered in other books.  One word of caution to those who don't read a lot of fantasy, be sure to give yourself a few chapters to get into this book.  Until I figured out how this world worked I found myself confused a lot, and I kept having to ask my husband to clarify certain points.  Once I &quot;got it&quot; though, I had no trouble reading.

While one human being can make it all horrible, the counter balance is another human being that makes it okay and allright.  This book is the perfect example of this.The author has courage, faith and a deep belief in herself and other human beings, which is more than I can say, at times and I have never had to experience half of what she has.This book is written by a woman, for women everywhere.

7841122,Nice but with minor flaws,"Overall, I'm generally happy with this bread maker. My experience and observations follow.Pros:Easy to useRelatively quiet (except for the beeps)Plentiful optionsThe included recipes are quite good. I've tried several but not all.Cons:Slightly larger foot print than my previous machine that made similarly sized loafPaddle gets backed onto rod every single time and is difficult to remove even after soakingLoaf pan rocks during mixing, which is something my previous bread maker didn't do; Uncertain if this is normal or a defect.The recipe section of the owner's manual should be reorganized. In case the powers that be are reading this review, please, Please, PLEASE display recipes alphabetically rather than by function number.Cheers!=^..^=",4,1
1947091,Good introduction,"This was a pretty good introduction to the Maya. It has a lot of good reference materials in it, such as time lines and maps. In some areas the writing is a little dry and dull, but overall I felt like I had gotten a fairly good overview of the Maya when I was done. He presents both popular and marginal theories on the various mysteries of the Maya. He is thourough in covering the various aspects of the Maya and I felt it was a good place to start if you are interested in learning more about this culture.",4,1
9227948,Task Force,"This is a good movie about the development of naval aviation and carriers. Gary Cooper and Jane Wyman give their usual fine performances. The movie is a flashback of Gary Cooper's life right beginning at the time he is retiring from the Navy, going over the many memories he had in his struggle to promote carriers and naval aviation, finally to see it at its finest capability, effectiveness, and almost prolific numbers in the Pacific theater, beating down the Japanese air forces and island fortresses. It has some authentic aerial film that you see in most war flicks but still this is a worthwhile purchase to add to your war flick library and an enjoyable film to watch. Boy was Jane Wyman was really beautiful in her prime.",4,1

8883118,A Vibrant Story of Survival &amp; Home...,"Phillip Noyce is mostly known for his action/suspense films such as Dead Calm (1989) and The Saint (1997).  However, in this production he is outdoing himself with a vibrant survival story about the journey of three young back to their home from which they have been taken due to Australia's policy in regards to aborigines.  Rabbit-Proof Fence provides a great opportunity to visually experience the girls struggle to reach their goal to get home.  This struggle elevates the meaning of hope in our world.  In short, the story itself offers a brilliant cinematic experience with Kenneth Branagh as A. O. Neville enhancing the overall experience as well.",5,1

They played a ""shoot-em"" game (or a more accurate description these days would be a ""laser-em"" game) on the iPad without the joystick, then with it. According to my guys, the game (Solomon's Keep) was much easier to play with the joystick than without. It made it a more tactile experience, and their movement and targetting was more accurate. The suction cups held up well - no sliding around on the pad. They also remarked that it didn't get in the way of their game playing, as they originally thought it would. So it gets a thumbs up from my crew.",5,1

8986994,Tom Cruise plays somone other than himself,"This is an interesting role for tom Cruise. Many times, you'll see him playing himself in films - by that I mean, you never quite lose the line between him and his character.And that works for him.In this film, you get a glimpse of how he is learning to transcend his own character and lose himself more fully in his roles. As he matures as an actor, and not just a blockbuster draw, I really think those kinds of transformations are going to be his best asset.The story in the film is touching and ironic, and is respectful of all the cultures represented within it. Are they accurate portrayals? That depends on which side of the lens you're on.",4,1

I could give you a lift, as a thank you for allowing me to hide in your bathroom like a coward."" He's a jokester, ""dinner tonight?"" he asked. ""Unless you're still mad at me for shushing you."" His dark eyes were hungry and wolf-like, impossible to look away from. ""Shushing you is something I swear I'll never do again."" He's also a naughty boy, ""I can't stop thinking about the other night in the car. I should have laid you back on the seat, put your legs up on my shoulders, and pulled off your panties with my teeth."" Oh my word! He makes any situation fun even if it is a serious one, ""I'm sorry to hear that. And I'm doubly sorry to be poking my boner into your belly button while you're telling me this very personal story."" I didn't like how there was a cliffhanger of sorts I didn't realize this was a damn series.",5,1
9273379,Serious weirdness,"But I mean that in a good way. The animation style tends self-consciously towards the unpolished - but the stiff, jerky motions perfectly suit the sense that these characters could  have been plastic toys, right down to the little stand beneath their feet, in my own childhood toybox. The main characters, Cowboy (a cowboy), Indian (an Indian), and Horse (you guessed it) have an equally self-conscious feel about their characters' names.What really makes this strange little treat is its surreal meanderings from one improbable scene to another - the upside-down aquatic village, horses playing specially modified pianos, and even (spoiler) a battle fought using pigs and swordfish as projectiles. Of the little rational flow the creators left in this production, I probably missed a good portion. I watched without subtitles, but admit French to be among my many lacks. All the more reason to see it again!-- wiredweird",4,1

And I did.This is the story of a tough guy from a rough home and journey with a 57 Chevy.

It is out of the traditional Chicago setting that is crucial to Father Dowling, but the characters are different. Father Dowling is less patient, and Steve looks like she is going into acting.  All the other episodes were a fitting end to the series. The last episode has a very nice twist (no plot spoiler) that actually redeems one of the characters.",5,1

3350471,Interesting read about life as a pediatric resident,"I was drawn to this book because I enjoy medical memoirs.  Between Expectations is written by a Pediatric ER physician about her time as a pediatric resident.  There are harrowing stories about patients who died, who survived, and how these experiences impacted her.  There is even a chapter where she travelled to a foreign country to help administer medical care.  Overall, her writing is impressive in it's layers.  I can tell that she painstakingly chose each word to convey the exact meaning she was desiring it to.  Not surprising since she's a doctor!  The only knock on this book is that it is a little dense, and difficult to read for a layperson.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone considering the field of pediatrics.Other pediatricians who write include Perri KlassA Not Entirely Benign Procedure, Revised Edition: Four Years as a Medical Studentand Jennifer ShuFood Fights: Winning the Nutritional Challenges of Parenthood Armed with Insight, Humor, and a Bottle of Ketchup.

They don't look like they'd take a lot of tugging to don't load the chest heavily or put it someplace where you need real effort to get it back out, it's just not designed for that.It's just the right sizer to slide under a bed or up on a closet shelf.

Most likely, the reason for that is because this book really does not discuss much about financial issues and advice. Instead, this book is focused on and can be summed up by one verb/word: Capitalize. What does that mean? That's difficult to say to anyone who hasn't read this book yet, since there are so many layers to that verb/word. Interpret that verb/word the way you want to.Whatever the interpretation, disabuse your mind of Robert's 2 popular books (i.e. Rich Dad, Poor Dad & Cash Flow Quadrant) and read this book to go against the crowd.",5,1
4168682,An Interesting Epic,"I picked up the book by chance after reading the two other reviews.  I felt as if I were reading a ""Gone with the Wind"" for the Viking era.  A great historical fiction that offers up a rich tapestry of the early Scottish and Pictish societies as they struggle against the Viking invaders as well as old beliefs that still hold sway in the acceptance of Christianity.  However, be warned that this is definitely not a romance novel.  The heroine, even accounting for the time when she lives, is not a likable person and keeps making rash, unwise decisions that hurtle her from one disaster to another.  The only redeeming quality is her constant devotion to her son.  The jarl, despite being a berserker and all that it entails, comes across as a more sympathetic character.  The book left me wondering what'll happen to them once her famed beauty fades and her son is properly assimilated to the Viking society.  ""Gritty"" is the right word.",4,1

My mother, who has always supported my very different views of life, has read this and says that everyone who is different should read it too. If you are a Goth, or if you just know someone who is - or even if you ever just wanted to know more about that Goth things any way - read this book. You will laugh and learn. And probably break down and shop too.",5,1
813774,"Engrossing, but not as good as Eon","I loved the first book, Eon. This one is tough for me to review - I was completely engrossed while reading it and didn't want to put it down. But I didn't like Eona herself as much as I did in the first book. I felt like she squandered so much potential and opportunity by not trusting anyone with the whole truth. I finished it more than a week ago and I still don't really know how I feel about it. But if you liked Eon, I don't see how you could possibly resist reading the sequel!(Note: I received a free advance reading copy of this book from the publisher at an American Library Association Annual Conference. I was not required to write a positive review. Thank you, Viking!)",4,1

From the moment I downloaded it, I had difficulty not reading from start to finish - I say that because after all, I do have to work! It was a very quick, enjoyable read. I'm usually more of a contemporary romance person, and this story made me realize I was missing a lot of different authors!I would recommend this book as one to get if you aren't certain you will enjoy the genre or the author. I didn't want to put it down and I will look for more by this author.

1722671,Parting is such sweet sorrow,"This final instalment of Harry Potter's story is perhaps the most satisfying book in the entire series.  The story epic in its scope, filling in gaps left in the earlier books and tying many threads together as Harry and his friends struggle to complete the tasks given to them by Dumbledore.  The challenges they face at times seem impossible to meet, but they struggle through their doubts and through teamwork and a bit of luck, arrive at the final showdown with Lord Voldemort, where Harry finally meets his destiny.For fans of Harry Potter, this book will be both sweet and bitter.  This book finishes Harry's tale with grand style that should prove satisfying those who have fallen in love with our young hero and his friends.  But it is also sad, because it is the end of his story, and we can no longer look forward to hearing more about these wonderful characters.  I guess we'll just have to go back and read them again...",5,1

6705891,Almost Perfect,"It really ""does everything"" at a very reasonable price. The real time traffic is a bit off a hype in my opinion. It never really tells you anything you don't already know and it's not terribly accurate re the real traffic conditions ahead but as a nav system it's superb. It's terribly intuitive and instructions are really not necesesary at all. You just play with the unit and you can learn everything you need just by playing around for a minutwe or two. It's database in amazing and it gets you wherever you need effortlessly. I wish it had a compass in a corner when it was guiding you, but there are ways to figure out what direction you're traveling in even without this. And, as others have mentioned, the built-in speaker is definitely tinny sounding at 80% volume. Above that I'd say it's unuseable. But the Bluetooth features are top notch and the text to speech works perfectly. A very, very nice little unit at a ridiculously affordable price.",5,1
2133159,My review for Colorado Mandala,"Brian is a gifted literary writer who knows his subject and characters as if they are real, and the location as if a native. He paints vivid, colorful scenes with descriptive words and visual images as if painting a picture of his own backyard. From the canyons and caves, to the river beyond and across scrub brush prairies and plains to Colorado's red rock cliff dwellings, the landscape is a kaleidoscope mix of colors, shapes and texture. The characters' lives are just as colorful, the threads and fiber woven together into a compelling story of love, hate, sacrifice and forgiveness. As a Colorado native, born and raised in Colorado Springs, living a short few miles from Manitou, I know the territory well, where the story takes place. Brian speaks about Manitou as if he could have been my neighbor. I was a young adult during the period of time that his story takes place, during the Vietnam War. Brian gives the story, its location and characters credible authenticity.",5,1
696050,Had to finish it,"Wait for you is a different story then the paranormal series of Jennifer L. Armentrout. It's a contemporary love story that includes difficult topics like shame, guilt and trauma's from the past. Due to a character like Cam I'm not able to go lower then a 5 star rating. He must be the most patient, responsible and sweet guy that I've ever read about (and don't forget beautiful). He's just the guy that Avery needs after a period of loneliness. I loved the story because it has been written in a way that it grasps you from the start and sucks you in until the end. I felt like I was part of the story. But that has to do with the writing style of Jennifer L. Armentrout since I love all her books. I've included Wait for You in my favourite book list together with books like Hopeless (Colleen Hoover), Fallen too far (Abbi Glines), Pushing the limits (Katie McGarry) or Find you in the dark (A.

All the characters, from Harry, to Hermione, to Hagrid, to professor Dumbledore and Malefoy all rode to work with me.

Bondoux is obviously one of those authors that think needlessly killing off a few protagonists is the height of literary excellence.  I admit I don't like those kinds of endings, ruins the whole story for me, but it might be a little more palatable if it weren't done in such an off-handed and abrupt manner.Anyway it did spoil the story for me and I went away from it with a bad taste in my mouth.NOT RECOMMENDED.",2,0

Loss and redemption, rewarding perserverance, this book could stand on its own; it's almost too bad that it will be taken as a book by, and about, a reality TV family.Heartily reccomended!!",5,1
1065650,92 Year Old Mystery Maven,"This interesting series of mysteries features Dorothy, who at 92, is a ""feisty woman who refuses to let the aches and pains of old age stop her from enjoying her multifarious activities"". Dorothy lives on Martha's Vineyard, where she is well-known thumbing rides from islanders as she walks to her various appointments. She is also a volunteer with the sheriff's department, and when acting in that capacity, she wears her special cap. Because of Dorothy's age, her experience in life enables her to look inside the human heart, often picking up clues missed by others.This is the second book in the series of seven books featuring this character. Each of the books is named after a plant, usually a native wildflower. I found the book enjoyable and the story riveting. Cynthia Riggs, the author, is a thirteenth generation islander, who with her daughter, runs a bed and breakfast, The Cleaveland House, a 1700's home. She said Dorothy is patterned after her own mother.",5,1

3713608,Glad I had read the first in the series...,"I would have missed so much if I hadn't read Dead is the New Black first.  All the character development and main character relationships are established in that first book.  Don't get me wrong, this is a very good read.  Once again, the author does a wonderful job with the mystery and keeping the reader wondering exactly who is the killer.  It just wouldn't have pulled me into the story as thoroughly without the background of these characters from the first book.There must have been some chapters proofread by different people, because the character of Roquelle Rik had her name changed to Rochelle and then back to Roqeulle at the end.  I've had an author tell me that sometimes an writer will do something like that on purpose, just to see how thoroughly the readers are invested in the story.  If that's what was done here, stop it!  It's irritating and takes away from the flow of the book.I'm looking forward to another in this series.",4,1
296132,took advantage of the waiting game,"I love this app but jeez the 24 hour wait just has to come up when it gets to the good part. I do wish there was a way to get rid of that. I'm totally a fan of Masa. Maybe because he kind of has a dark side in his personality. But anyways, I know the waiting 24 hours thing sucks but I just take advantage of that by reading a little bit of the chapter every 2 to 3 hours. You should try that so u don't have to waste money on the ticket thingymebobers that are overpriced. :) also when you read a little bit of the chapter of this story it gives u time to fantasize about what might happen next. This app is mainly for patient people I guess but if there wasn't the whole wait for 24 hours thing, it wouldn't be much of a story if you just rush through the chapters now would it? I can't wait to read the next character after Masa's story.comments from me Blazy :)",5,1
9164078,GREAT MOVIE THAT WON'T DISAPPOINT!,"Just thought I'd add my 2 cents to the other great reviewers here who convinced me to watch this sweet film.not only am I left with good feelings after the movie, but I plan to watch again soon.  Why?  Despite a little mystery  regarding the timeline of the story (it DOES take a moment to figure out the sequence of events), it was fully worth the small effort.  Also I was afraid it would be one of those touchy-feely movies that leave you feeling sad all over....  nope.  It was actually uplifting- though I couldn't put my finger on why.  IF it had had fewer superb actors, dialogue exchanges, and happy endings.... then I might have decided differently.  But don't be afraid to try it out.Great movie that won't disappoint.",5,1

Before I get into my review I'm going to talk about the cover of the film, notice those two guys fighting? Well they never ever appear in the film. Some guy thought it would be a good idea to put a couple of people fighting because it might sell some more copies.And can someone tell me why they chose to make a sequel to one of his worse and most hated films.There are close to no fight scenes in this movie and when Seagal is supposed to fight it's just his stunt man. The film is full of bad acting, dubbing, stunt men and stock footage. The story is lame, a poor excuse at trying to make a suspenseful movie. Don't buy this movie, save your money. 0/5",1,0

588643,"Loved it, Loved it, Loved it.","I have been waiting patiently to read my copy of The Strain, I had to give myself a free weekend without interruptions because part of me knew I wouldn't be able to put it down and I was right.Del Toro and Hogan have given us a tightly woven, fascinating, fun, and downright scary as heck vampire novel! It's a book that is full of so many themes; infection, family bonds, mystery, and legends. Its about one mans life long mission to seek out the very evil that will destroy the earth. It's about another mans job to find out what has killed a plane full of passengers and is now loose on the city. It's about being in your house and one by one your neighbors have turned into something so monstrous and incapable of reason, and all they want to do is have you join them.If you love Del Toro's films, then you will adore how he and Hogan have been able to imprint on the readers mind such brilliant images, horrifying and as clear as day.

All I was looking for were a pair that had decent sound with mic and volume control, and these do great.My only issue is that you do get a lot of noise coming through when the cord comes in contact with stuff. Such as when it rubs against your clothing, you'll hear that through the buds. It's mainly noticeable when listening to lower volume stuff. Other than that, I can't complain.",4,1
1809498,Don't Tell,I really enjoyed this book so much. I read it in 2 days and if I hadn't been sleepy I would have stayed up all night the first night.The author has a talent in writing that makes you feel like you know the characters. It was filled with suspense that kept you on the egde of your seat but it also had a love story.I was so sad when the story ended I wanted to read more.After finishing the book I went to the author's website and found out that her next book won't be out until February 2004.And that Don't Tell was her first book. I give this book 5 stars.Pam,5,1
1331856,Incredible chutzpah,"What an annoying, gimmicky, pointless little screed.  Andersen apparently believes that she's offering an  &#34;Alternative history&#34; novel series.  What she has actually produced is an inane costume-romance wannabe, not even rising the the level of an interesting romance.  It attempts validity by gratuitously slapping the names of actually historical persons onto a few characters.  In fact you can't really call them characters; they're entities that should be arrested for impersonating a character.  That's especially true of the ones with historical names attached--any resemblance to the real person is purely accidental.Alternative history is a valid genre, demanding a significant grasp of the history from which it diverges and logical connections to it,. This period's events and people were infinitely more exciting, complex, and intense.  It takes incredible nerve to try to substitute this flat, thin tale.",1,0

1465160,Shift,"Entertaining pile of trivia about the English language (as well as many other languages). For example, &#34;the military vehicle the tank got its name because during its secretive experimental phase people were encouraged to think it was a storage receptacle.&#34;I'd had no idea how arbitrary the creation of our language was, and found myself quite stunned at times. Loved the idea that all languages might well be derivations of one original shared language.I found it interesting that in writing a book (published in 1990) that documents the haphazard progress of the English language, Bill Bryson himself seems unconsciously to illustrate a shift in usage by moving randomly from his preferred 'male as default' bias (most examples use 'he') to an occasional 'he or she' and a rare singular pronoun 'they.'Natasha HolmeAuthor of 'Lesbian Crushes and Bulimia: A Diary on How I Acquired my Eating Disorder'",4,1

I bought this to use with my iDevices as part of a comprehensive power system: retractable cable, micro USB to Lightning adapter, Apple 10W power block, and an Anker battery bought here.

It IS possible to have a great story without the potty mouth and flirt without being filthy.  I love a good story.  This would make a good movie too.  I hope there are many more books to come from this writer.Thanks, Mr. Phil for the great job of reading the story. D.",5,1
4412949,Wow,Sylvia Day is just amazing as a writer.  To write about romance and sex from the 1800's and early 1900's is so different than today's romance/erotica novels.

5660565,Debut,"This is my favorite Santana album.  Being their first, it is not as diverse or exploratory as others, but its consistency is solid.  I am a huge fan of blues music, and this album is Santana's most outwardly bluesy  album. &quot;Persuasion&quot; and &quot;Treat&quot; are wonderful.  And the  Woodstock cut of &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot; was absolutely one of the most  intense renditions of any song at that concert.  And Jimi Hendrix was  there. Now, to even come close to Hendrix, one must whip-a**, and  &quot;Soul Sac&quot; does just that.  Check the drum solo.  Whoa.  &quot;Fried Neckbones&quot; also teems with bubbling intensity. And for you  Top 40 pop rocker dudes, &quot;Evil Ways&quot; should keep your  unadventursome ears off of the radio for a while.  Along with &quot;The  Doors,&quot; &quot;Are You Experienced,&quot; and &quot;Led Zeppelin  1,&quot; this album is one of the finest debuts of the 60s.",4,1

He says he was a historian for Freddie Mac, but the history he wrote for them didn't work and this history is a travesty as well.

I am using a SoundBlaster Audigy ZS sound card and this seems to be a match made in heaven. The setup was fairly easy and my only complaint is the speaker wire on the Center and Left &amp; Right front speakers could be longer.  Also the Subwoofer is very large and I had a hard time finding a big enough space for it. At the price I paid for these speakers you can not beat the value. My biggest problem is that the rest of my family doesn't have the same appreciation of music and they keep turning the volume down.JR,5,1

The orchestra is loud and some of the singing is barely audible, especially at the very beginning.  This is true with two separate sets of this performance that I bought; two different labels.  The EMI might be a little better.  It's still worth having, for sure.  I also have this on audio cassettes and the sound is more muffled, but more balanced.  I also have the Leontyne Price/Franco Corelli 1962 Met radio performance.  It is a miracle.  In 70 years of loving opera I have never heard more glorious singing.  The orchestra and enraptured audience response just add to the experience.  I would say that a Puccini lover must have both of these great performances.",5,1

Set in South Africa in the not-so-distant future, Zinzi has been convicted of a serious crime, and thus is committed to a lifelong bonding with an animal (which also grants her a special power). This of course marks and separates her as a criminal...Zinzi is on the receiving end of just about every prejudice one can experience (plus the new one that is the basis for the story).. oh wait, she's decidedly heterosexual, so she misses that one... but she gets a dose of all the others at one point or another. A very sympathetic character with lots of backstory still untold. I look forward to learning more about her.",5,1

You find yourself drawn to the characters and wanting everything to turn out right for Don Lorenzo and his friends.The genre is the Steampunk with a twist of an alternative earth.

Unlike other cheap Chinese items I have had the distinct displeasure of purchasing, these particular radios are feature packed and of very acceptable quality when compared to the higher end hand held radios.

7723632,finally a feasible alternative to canned air,I've been shopping for an alternative to canned air.  I don't like canned air because it loses strength when it get's cold from prolonged use.What I like about this product.Good blast of air that can be sustained unlike the cans.Made in the USA.  Wow this and my new balance shoes.  Imagaine that.  We actually can build stuff here.Fairly effective and hopefully in the end saves money and the landfills.What I didn't like:The top of the unit has a gap and a lot of air blows out the gap.The attachments restrict the air flow and a LOT more air gets blown out of the gap.  It actually works better without the attachment.The filter is difficult to remove and it's not a very good fit.Very loud. It's a tradeoff > powerful sustained blast of air but loud and gets pretty warm.Overall the trade offs are in favor of the product definitely over the canned air but not sure if air compressor with water catcher isn't a better choice.,4,1

For those who care, the transfer is  a great-looking Anamorphic Widescreen one with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.

The story was sweet, the characters could have been developed a little more, but overall it was a good read and worth reading.",4,1

It's about a ring, a conspiracy, the end of the world and the 2 couples who are caught up in it's tangled web.

The new music sounds like the early material from Bridge of Sighs. The vocals sound like James Dewar. Great vocals from Davey Pattison on this DVD.I would love to hear a Paul Rodgers collaberation with vocals on some new and old Robin Trower songs. The bonus interview was great to hear Robin Trower talk about his history in music. This is a great DVD in sound and picture quality.,5,1
3098031,Better and better,"I keep waiting for this series to disappoint me, and so far they haven't.  Each story is the same in some ways, as all chick lit romance seems to have a formula.  But when I read these books I want to know there will be a happy ending, so that's okay with me.As well as having similarities, they are also different enough that they do not get confused in my mind.  I think that certainly says something about the writing of Ms. Foster.Yes, I got pissed at Josh quite a few times.  But if I were in his shoes would my mind have thought the same thoughts?  Probably.  Why is it that I'm willing to suspend my disbelief and be okay with characters finding insta-love, but when they try to think rationally I have a problem?As much as Josh upset me, I found him to also be the most thoughtful of the brothers in the way he remembers so many details about Riley and the things she has mentioned, even if just in passing.I can't wait to find out more about Dane next!",4,1

The cable is HDMI to DVI, for this you need the other cables described above.  If both are HDMI, then the audio is is through the cable and you do not need the separate audio cables.

Thankfully I held my breath for a few more sentences and met a main character that I immediately liked. If i met Mary in real life, i'd have to say she's sure got moxie. She's smart, witty, and determined, without being foul or overly bravadoed. She's got grit, but admits when she needs help, and makes appropriate decisions based on her character development.The mystery plot is well thought out and executed in a way that lets the reader sleuth along with Mary. The storyline is a straightforward whodunit, without being dark or cynical.  The supporting cast are fun, and the humor woven throughout keeps the tone pretty evenly balanced between moments of progress and tension.I certainly look forward to reading subsequent books in this series!",4,1

Reading the &#8220;cover&#8221; on what the book was about didn&#8217;t give much on who the HERO would be. And it was interesting to see Lily remember a love of so long ago, but still be open to possibilities. I like that she stayed true to herself and when she opened her heart to the one she wanted to be with. I enjoyed their conversation and connection.Spoiler Alert &#8211; what I have to say I hated about this book is to learn that after the author has written 3 books for each of the ladies and their love stories, she&#8217;s going to go back and write a new book a continuation of the first &#8211; a continuation of Jason and Gabby&#8217;s story&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry but seriously?",4,1

The text complements the stunning photographs of dogs in various positions and actions.The only complaint I would level at the book is that for the $16.99 MSRP I had hoped for perhaps not all, but some, full color photos. The only full color photos are on the cover. All of the other photos in the book are black and white.If you know a dog lover, do them a favor and surprise them with this book.

There are many elements in the plot including religion, global warming, science, tradition, family relationships, and love.  Kingsolver is always excellent at descriptive imagery which I enjoy.

The suspense, palpable. The relationships, raw and real. James crafted perfectly placed moments for readers to breathe, find hope and even laugh&#8212;sometimes through a few tears. I loved the hope laced throughout the story and was pleasantly surprised and fascinated by a supernatural gift given to the heroine, which did not take away from the overall story or the gritty realism.I was thoroughly impressed with this book and can&#8217;t wait to see where the series goes.",5,1

The story line is a step above the norm. The suspense is top notch.Caroline is a lovely young woman struggling with her past...you will love her.  Lynn is a compassionate psychiatric nurse who cares deeply about her patients...you will admire her.

Chagnon's observation that these prehistoric people (Yanomamo, not anthropologists) live in a world of darkness and fear is supported by other equally unpopular works, among them 'War Before Civilization'.",5,1

I tend to order 9's when in doubt, but usually they end up too big ( which I tend to wear anyways). I decided to order the 9 in these. They do run small because this 9 fits like a glove. When I first put my feet in these, they were snug, but within about 20 minutes they loosened up to fit perfectly. I wouldn't want these too big. My feet are not slim or wide. They are just normal.  Hope this helps anyone questioning the sizes. I was so worried after reading reviews and almost didn't order these. Glad I did. So cute. Nice quality.",5,1

They are a 2.0 design (no separate bass unit - that should be obvious from the picture) which was what I was looking for.

6490201,Best Stylus So Far,"I bought this stylus for the sole purpose of writing notes and actually ""writing"" via one of the many note taking apps out there (my favorite is Ghostwriter).  This is the best stylus so far.  I feared the worst when I ordered it because previous versions I used had a more sticky, rubber tip and the pen did not glide smoothly.  This one does.  Its response is quick and I've had no trouble resting my hand on the ipad itself while writing.  My ONLY complaint (and it almost lost a star for this), is the size.  Could somebody (preferably BoxWave) please make a FULL SIZE stylus so it feels like a real pen in my hands???  Having said that, even though it isn't quite long enough, it still fits okay, will do for now and does the job really, really well (and I have big hands).  I ordered through Amazon and it arrived within about 4 days.",5,1
8453088,A great story,"February and the Single Heart is a great story that follows the troubles of Mary Jo. There are so many levels to this story, and it is so well written and intriguing that you'll be pulled into Mary's world. Once you're pulled in, you'll find yourself desperate to find out if things will work out for her. It begins in a disgusting prison, and goes back to a time in her teen years when she was kidnapped and rescued by a young man. Years later, Mary must rely on this young man once again, but this time she fears if she can truly put her faith in him, or if she will be forced to spend the rest of her life in prison. An incredible read from beginning to end. I look forward to more books from this author. Their writing style was engaging and the imagery makes you feel as if you're following Mary Jo on her journey to freedom at two different times in her life. At first you aren't sure if Mary Jo is even innocent, but soon you'll be in intense suspense to find out what will happen to her.",5,1

Almost everything that happens happens in one or two paragraphs and then the story abruptly ends. We don't even get to savor the climax with a page or two of retrospective. He really put no effort into this.",1,0
1973156,Huge huge disappointment,"I always have read the books in this series and eagerly waited for the next but the last few have the characters going off in very unbelievable directions.  It's as if the author thinks that if they aren't in terrible situations we won't read the book.  I found this last one to be difficult to read--too wordy, too self absorbed, too something.  The plot was unbelievable--like others have said would Sam and Alan really choose a room in ICU where nurses come and go all the time to discuss a murder?  I'm a nurse and as far as a patient in a coma remembering details like that is nuts.  Like others I don't know if I'll even bother reading the last book if this is the direction the author goes.",1,0

987918,Enemies are necessary,"This was a very interesting perspective.  The author sort to make the reader aware that if you are destined for greatness you will go through great trial.  Your ministry will be birthed through your pain.  What I thought was so profound was the reason for the test.  People normally say that when we are going through a test it is because God is trying to teach us a lesson.  However, the test measures what you already know.  So the teacher is silent during the test and does not allow anyone to talk to you because this is not a collaborative effort.  This forces you to focus on the test.  Wow! this is true in the natural so it follows that it would be true in the spirit also.  An enemy forces us to focus on what we know to be true.  This book was written in bite size chunks making it easy to digest.  Persecution follows prosperity so get ready.

Well, now I'm too embarrassed to give it to her.  Don't get me wrong, I am glad she overcame her illness and everything else she had to deal with, but some of the things she says are just filthy.Just because that's the way you talk at home or to your family doesn't mean you should put it in a book!  God! Come on.  I was raised by Southerners who didn't know the difference between good and bad grammar but I'm sure Paula knows the difference.  And another thing.  So much of the book doesn't even sound like Paula.  I think huge sections are basically her ghost writer's words because Paula's ""voice"" just isn't there.  I agree with the other posters that said to save your money.  You can get most of the story from her shows.Oh, and Paula's Party show stinks.  It is almost too painful to watch.Lucky",2,0

P.J. reminds me on me, strong willed and wanting to help others but all of the men vying for her love would be even too much for me as tempting as they each are. At times I felt like I wanted to smack one guy or another and sometimes even P.J. for her choices.  There were many surprises for me that I didn&#8217;t expect and that made the story more intriguing to me. The mild sexual content was enough to wet your appetite and well placed in the story.

The LINX is an excellent machine, it seems to pick up as well as my corded vacuums, is lightweight, stores well and is very attractive. The only negative is the longevity of the battery charge, which can be remedied by vacuuming several rooms, recharging then resuming, or by purchasing a second battery. With two batteries I can vacuum my entire 3400 sf house, including hard floors, with a little power to spare.Patsy Williams",5,1
3393254,Excellent series that just keeps getting better,"I really love this series and the books just keep getting better and better. After a couple of books that covered a lot of the same ground, there's some real forward movement this time as Benny and his friends make some considerable progress in their quest to locate the source of the jet they saw flying overhead many months ago. Unfortunately, as we've seen time and again, all is not well out in the great ""rot & ruin"" and there are dangers much worse than the zombies or ""gray people."" Such as the Night Church, the followers of Thanatos, the ""reapers"" whose mission it is to cleanse the world of the remnants of humanity. Led by the frightening Saint John and Mother Rose, these fanatics are bent on freeing the souls of any heretics they come by and sending them to the darkness. Benny, Nix, Lilah, and Chong have their work cut out for them and it might prove to be just a bit too much...",5,1

2919704,Good book for teens to read,"So often teens get this ""It won't happen to me"" syndrome and they take all kinds of chances because they are listening to the wrong voice, making stupid choices. Michelle Sutton writes what can happen if...It is a compelling story with all the drama, and yet the story asks some truly soul searching questions which any young adult must have answers to before It Happens To Them. Sutton shows that all things are possible with God which is a most excellent message for today. We really need, as a society, to quit focusing on self and start acting for the best interests of others, most especially for those we love.Good, well written story with believable characters which are well developed. Good, satisfying ending. I did get quite tired of the whining, I suppose that's part of life, too, when you are learning to make choices that will be for the benefit of someone else.Gina's other reviews are at [...]",4,1

Will masking her own problems cause her to lose her kids?&#8220;Just Beneath the Surface I&#8221; portrays a realistic account of domestic abuse and the effects it can have on an entire family.

This is a book I'd recommend. It's a well-written page turner packed with a powerful message.Reviewed by: Jas",4,1
7495943,Perfect choice,Purchased this unit to replace an older model and it works as advertised. Fortunately I had ordered three units to replace all of the ageing units in our townhouse. These units did not play well with the older models and replacing all three would have been a requirement. I like the voice feature and the fact that it incorporated both Smoke and CO detection in a single housing. The battery backup is a worthwhile feature as well,4,1

So I'm just saying be aware!BTW - when this review of mine gets o out of 100 ""helpful"" it means 0 out of 100 don't ""agree"", that isn't the same as helpful, Steve Wilson reminds me of the Beatles as far as talent goes and I'm just saying this CD is NOT the Steve I know and love.DVD disc is 5.1 audio - no actual video",1,0

If there was a way to give it zero stars I would have done that.  The mother was just awful to her daughters and the fairy tale excruciating to read. The characters were all so unlikeable, the story was boring and the book made me so angry that I continued to read it.  I should have my head examined for reading ""Night Road"" some time afterwards since it is also on my list of worst books. It was completely predictable right from the start and it was most likely the last book of hers I will read since it is obvious that many people can't be trusted with their reviews.

I started it early this morning, and fortunately I was able to put off doing the cleaning, the grocery shopping--everything--just because this book is probably one of the best I have ever read, and I am a voracious reader. Told from the point of view of five people and set, as are Rash books in the Carolinas, it is a story that will challenge the reader's values--is there ever a cause to murder someone?

A quick read and while a little fluffy, I liked the interaction between the characters; however, I would love to get some more in depth background on some of the characters. I think that the moral of the story are very clear, but definitely a black and white world that the Adepts have chosen to espouse. I especially liked Scout and Lily's friendship and Lily's easy acceptance of what is really going on at St. Sophia's. The only question is...will Lily come through the ordeals she must face as she was...or will it change her life forever?

One part made me sad but the hatred between sisters really got on my nerves at times. Nisa knows how to capture you in her books and she definetly did that again in this book but it was just something that I could not put my finger own.

4262034,Very interesting book.,"I have read other books about Katherine Hepburn, but this one had a unique point of view: what can we learn from looking at KH's life and her personality? I think the author took a realistic look at Hepburn. She clearly showed Hepburn's many strengths and the lessons that can be learned from those strengths. But she did not paint Hepburn as perfect. The author showed Hepburn's stubborn side and her tendency to use denial throughout her life to maintain an idealized version of the truth. The author was also very realistic about the Hepburn-Tracy love affair and presented that relationship in a different light than other books/articles I've read. As a long-time KH fan, I loved getting a sense of what Hepburn was really like as a person and friend. This book did not focus on the typical Hollywood hype about a mega-star's glamorous life. It was a fun, interesting and easy read. Very enjoyable and at times thought-provoking.",4,1

I'm really not into witches but I gave it a try and in the end it was a decision that I was happy that I made. I was blown away of how Lotempio gave me a good picture of the book. It was an easy read for a book with so much information to remember. There was never a dull moment throughout the book. Though I though Morgan was somewhat whiny and negative throughout the story but a still good female heroine.I am definitely hungry for more.

6947199,"Used with a Nintendo Wii--so-so usability, but GREAT picture!","I purchased a different converter to get component signals to a VGA computer monitor, and bought this unit after that one failed. I wish I had discovered this one sooner!First, this product appears well made (heavy metal), and it WORKED right out of the box with no fidgeting. In addition, the colors and sharpness were NOTICEABLY better than a competitors product--even my wife noticed. Also, it passes audio like it should (another unit I had failed to pass stereo correctly), and doesn't run hot or anything.The only downside is that this unit is always passing a signal, so your monitor will never shut-off automatically, even if your Wii (or other output device) is off. Also, this unit will turn itself off after awhile, so you have to leave it out so you can turn it back on manually the next time you want to use your Wii (or other device).So, the usability could definitely be improved, but until the Wii U comes out with high-def output, this box definitely does the trick.",4,1

It is second only to The Dark Night, the 2nd movie in this trilogy.It shows a darker Batman than you saw in the Michael Keaton version. (Though that version will always hold a special place in my heart). This movie makes all the Batman gadets and his stroy line almost plausible, rather than the comic book version Michael Keton was in. That gives the whole film a much more realsistic and immersive experience. (I'm not even going to compare this to the Val Kilmer / George Clooney festivals of awfulness).",5,1

The rhyming isn't the best, but their delivery stands alone in my mind.  It goes with the music perfectly.  And the music goes with the lyrics in the same way.  It's got some normal tracks as well as some live instruments.

I do not doubt that Hoover used illegal  means for his person goals, but I would much rather have read a book that  gives me the feeling I should take it seriously, because it shows on every  page and footnote it takes itself and its investigation serious. This  unbalanced account of his life has flipped over to one side, proclaiming  Hoover the bad guy, without exploring even the possiblilty of a positive  side of the man. It's as if the writer settles a scoure here. It left me  with the uneasy feeling I do not know WHAT to believe and what to  discard.If you like a good scandal, this is your book.

469666,Fast Paced Adventure,"Barracuda 945 by Patrick Robinson is a fun, well-written, fast paced adventure novel. I have read several of Mr. Robinson's books and this is one of his best.

I am currently reading Scimitar SL-2, which generally takes up where Barracuda 945 left off and does so very well so far. Mr. Robinson writes good miltary fiction on a world-wide scale dealing mostly with submarines and Seals, with a few picks, and justifyably so, at a couple of past liberal Presidents who let our military down along the way. Some of the plots may be a little ""imaginative"" but they make for interesting stories and characters, and just a good, fun read for the military fiction fan.",5,1

9422119,"""The Comedy"" it is not.","This film appears to be about a psychopath who lives life only through the live scenarios he creates using other people in order to gratify his limited being.  He is bored and his scenarios are pointless to viewers with more normal real minds.  Because of this, the entire film is probably viewed by most as pointless unless one has some sort of interest in the filmmakers' view of their character's deviate behavior.  But since this behavior is created by the filmmakers, it is not real, and could only possibly provide limited insight into their minds and motives for making such a film.  Much of the film is sick because it merely reflects the sickness of the psychopathic main character.  I do not think it can be called a character study because no character exists to study outside of the filmmakers' imagination.  I could not even assess the quality of acting because I would not know how such a character should behave.  Accordingly, I cannot find a reason to recommend this film to anyone.",1,0

Why did Mark Waid think that this was the way to follow up Kingdom Come? There were too many mistakes here to be believed, the story was bad, the art was bad, and all it served was to create a plot device that completely undo's Crisis and is sure to be an even bigger mistake in the future. It also screws up Alex Ross's character designs. Batman doesn't wear his helmet in the final part, why do we want to see an old man in Bat-armor. The Flash's look is reduced to the regular custume with Jay Garrick's Helmet (why, why, why!!!?).  In it's defense the filler stories showcasing the Kingdom Come characters decent, enjoyable stories with good art exploring the Kingdom Come future, which is what a KC sequel should have been about.

2651211,Excellent first effort,"Having been a James Lee Burke fan for quite some time, I fully expected to find an intriguing tale, but with JLB overtones. Not at all. Judgement Calls is fast-paced, immediately engaging and definitely the author's own. The dialog is realistic, sharp and often very funny. Burke's Samantha Kincaid is well drawn, an imperfect, thoroughly likable, bright Assistant District Attorney with minor emotional baggage (no angst) and an attitude to which any woman can relate. The other characters are better than adequate; not as detailed as one might like, but their motivations are clearly understood. The story is a gut-wrencher for anyone with teens (and Burke gets the teen attitude down to the rolling-eye sighs!). The story is a little convoluted, perhaps because of the legal details, but it pulls you in and by the end you've got it. I'm glad I started this book on Friday evening, because I was up all night finishing it!",5,1

It is a dark story to be told. The end of days cant all be fun and candy. I hope the next book goes even deeper into the depths of the characters souls....Loved this bookJim,5,1
8748082,"Great movie, well-acted",All fo the actors were incredible in their roles. The music is incredible. It inspired me to seek out much more celtic-types of music when I first saw it not long after it came out. It is the type of movie you watch numerous times in your lifetime and it doesn't get old. DDL and MS are amazing actors.,5,1
3384067,REALLY enjoyed this book  - even more than the movie,"Every evening I looked forward to getting back to this book.  Even though I knew the main story from the film, the details provided in the book answered some questions I'd had during the movie.  The story moved along very well and kept me turning pages into the wee hours.  I will undoubtedly read it again in the future.  I always do that with books like this one that stick out in my mind as worth repeating!",5,1
828837,This book...,"reads like a novel, but it is a collection of recorded accounts by members of the Mayflower, their descendents, and observations from people from the period that lets you into the Pilgrims world.  It is not for those who wish to keep tradition and obscure the facts: these were very hardy individuals whom wanted to establish a Christian society free from the encumberance of an existing church while doing anything it took to survive in the wilderness; even if it means stealing the Native's corn or preemptively attacking them when you thought they might attack.  Needless to say such actions would ultimately bring these groups to conflict, but amazingly it took a full 56 years to do so!  This book is for those who want to know who the Pilgrims were, and how they differed from the Puritans, or the various Native tribes, or from the Dutch or the French.",4,1
8312681,Baking with kids,"This is a nicely illustrated children's story about a young goat named Billy who gets the opportunity to spend a day &#34;helping&#34; at a bakery.Naturally, as is often the case with young kids (especially if they really are goats), enthusiasm gets the better of common sense and things don't quite go as planned.It behooves the baker therefore not to let his young helper get a rise out of him, and of course a life lesson follows leading to a sweet ending.Easy fun reading with a moral attached.Amanda Richards - November 17, 2013",4,1

But the bags are not structured as shown in the picture, so they won't have any shape unless you fold the items inside and nearly fill the bags up. That said, these are sturdy and hold up well, even for moves. We transported a couple of these by the handles and they're holding up well so far. The cedar inserts are a plus.",4,1

3715672,Good Coverage of the Basics and Some Cardio Ideas,"Whilst, as some of the other reviewers have noted, the first sections of this book cover the generic basics of nutrition and exercise, I liked the way the information is presented / written and found myself reading the content anyway.  The latter half of the book basically provides a bunch of exercise ideas for how to cover your cardio requirements, other than pounding away in the gym.  Again, not rocket science but several good ideas here to bring some alternative options into your exercise regime.  I liked this book and found it good value for money given the relatively low cost.",4,1

2346422,"A fun and funny read, yet also poignant","The book is a lot of fun and the character is very interesting, a likable antihero who does some pretty devious things to his fellow ""good guys"" until his chance at redemption.  The puns get tiresome, but the story keeps you hooked.  My one complaint was that the book starts in media res.  I would recommend reading chapters 2 to 11, then chapter 1, then 12 to the end.  I wound having to reread chapter 1 when I got to the place it fit.",4,1
5424518,EXCELLENT!!,"For those who know JS Cooper's writing, this was an excellent read. For those who are unfamiliar, this is a great book to dig your mind into with the present and past reading. Also, she always leaves the reader hanging at the end, which is not much of a shock. However, if you are into the masculine, dominant millionaire, and the innocent girl, who also has a secret of her own, this is the book for you to read!! WARNING- you may find yourself not putting this book down for a few hours...so please cancel any plans you do have when you pick this book up!",5,1

2903607,Falls into the Snow Crash trap,"This book starts out strong, with an interesting premise -- a man finds himself in an unfamiliar place, with no memory of what came before. Eventually he comes to realize he's in a virtual world... and struggles to find his true identity.However, halfway through the book the narrative takes on a preachy note as the theme turns to God's love and His plan for our lives. While not explicitly Christian -- the name of Jesus is never mentioned -- that's the vibe it gives.It reminds me very much of Neal Stephenson's ""Snow Crash"" in that regard. While I think ""Snow Crash"" is a classic, Stephenson lost me in the second half of the book when he started delving into the Sumerian mythology. ""Vrin"" left the same sort of taste in my mouth.",2,0

520646,I &lt;3 Rachel Morgan!,"Another amazing book by Kim Harrison! Rachel Morgan is one of the most fabulous protagonists I have read about in a while. She is a smart, sassy redhead who's not afraid to kick butt. I think what I love most about her character is her versatility. She fights bad guys with super awesome demon-earth magic, martial arts combat skills, and her quick wits. Most of the time, her plans don't work out the way she wants them too, but she always manages to save the day in the end...sort of. There were a lot of surprises at this book which were definitely completely unexpected. I can't wait to read the next one and see what new twists the author will throw at us!",5,1

No chance now, because of the lack of content in the blu ray version. First, the episodes aren't the uncut versions. It looks like they are the the episodes that aired on tv almost 20 years ago.

5697129,tthe beginning of some classic musicians,This such a wonderful album the beginning of Stills and Young both wrote most of the songs some great songs that would become some classic songs of the time. I first picked this up when it came out I think I may have heard For What It's Worth and this was one of my favorite groups at the time. Like many people I would continue to follow their guys in the many groups that would grow from this group. Think about Stills and Young both playing lead singing and writing in the same group. Some wonderful singing on this one but then these guys went on to be with some of the best vocal groups of our time. This is such a wonderful album I forget just how great this album is. Sad that we only have the three albums from these guys.,5,1

511768,"Impossible to please everyone, but a good read!","An earlier reviewer incoherently castigated Bryson for not explaining why Shakespeare was great. I could say, rightly, that that reader missed the whole point of Bryson's book. Also, I don't think Bryson is the right person to write about why Shakespeare wrote what he wrote. There are scholars who have done, and will do, nothing but.  Face it, this book will not satisfy everyone, but anyone who can appreciate Bryson's witty approach will surely enjoy this.  The book summarizes what is known about Shakespeare's life and his world and manages to wrap in a good deal of infomation on speculations about the Bard's ""true"" identity.  I think that Bryson has done a great job.",4,1
8425765,Love this Book,"As always, Elizabeth Lennox has delivered. I got so wrapped up in the latest Thorpe family installment that I blocked out everything else and just read. It was fun seeing how these two loved one another from afar but were cautious about building a relationship outside of the office. Seeing a man with strong family support, one who steps out to provide what his lady needs (think shoes) was nice. I definitely recommend this book and again; the only reason it does not get a full five stars is due to errors where it looks like spell/grammar check accepted the spelling but the word was wrong. Proof reading is an important job in writing anything. The heroine should not become her sexy skirts and make-up and his muscles should be hard not lard. These are just a couple of the mistakes I found. Read, enjoy, skim over the poor choices in wording. This was the first of the Thorpe books for me. I am now going ignore everything here again and begin reading another.",4,1

Over and over I have found myself saying ""how does she think of this stuff"" or something like it. She has created a unique story and  world that I continue to explore and will follow until the end.

813176,A Great Giver-Like Novel,"This book is basically set in the same world as the Giver.  The society controls what you do for a career, who you will marry, etc. The main character, Cassia, is matched with her best friend, Xander.  But as the novel progresses, she realizes that she has feelings for a society outcast, Ky.  And as you can guess, a love triangle develops.This is the first book in the trilogy, and is a great book to set up the world and the characters.  If you like dystopian novels, especially the Giver, I recommend reading this trilogy.  It is good all the way until the end.",5,1
8490370,If You Only Knew #1,OMG!!!!! If only I could just copy and paste Nicola Haken's review. I feel the exact same way.

7541168,Wonderful.  Personal preference is secondary to air popper.,"Best alternative to an air popper for when you can't use one.  This is certainly by runner up, backup, choice.  This can burn the popcorn if you don't take it out in time and the popcorn tastes slightly better from an air popper because it doesn't steam the popcorn after it's been cooked like this does.A good bonus to this over an air popper is that it's really easy to add your salt, kernels, and oil/butter all at once before you even pop it.  It coasts it as evenly as possible, something you can't achieve at all with air-popped.",5,1
2103415,Not bad,This is a decent read. There is a decent story and the author writes it in a interesting way. You get some juicy details at the start that compel you to keep turning pages. I was not sold on a couple of the character interactions but but that's easy to overlook. Some of the info on organ transplants is inaccurate like the doc knowing when a transplant would be available. This is not a medical thriller so I didn't expect total accuracy. All in all I'd recommend this book. It was entertaining and well written. I'll look for more books by Andy Holloman in the future.,4,1

The book spans over 30 years and is divided into 3 parts.  I fell in love with Jenna and Randolph as well as Leigh and Noah; and loved to hate Angela.  Ms. Jackson you have outdone yourself and I can't wait to read more of your mainstream novels.  Keep up the good work",5,1

As for the movies, 1 & 2 are my favorites (I'm pretty sure I can recite Aliens by heart) but it was more cost effective to have the whole set.

8849552,A simple yet intriguing film.,"After watching Tigerland, you wonder how did Joel Schumacher manage to direct such a simple yet intriguing film after that horrible Batman &amp; Robin? This film is about the loyalty, integrity, fear and hope of men. I believe that the Vietnam War is simply used as a backdrop. This is an intense, psychological film. The plot isn't that great, but it's what Bozz's character that helps this film a very emotional piece. I'd say Colin Farrell is the next Mel Gibson, if not probably even better. After watching this film, there's something about it that makes you feel good, and you wanna enlist yourself to war. A must-see for all.",4,1

He summarizes the events of the Western Front (only--other theaters  are mentioned only as they impact Germany's decisions about force  allocation) quickly, perhaps too quickly for my taste. He slows down a  little bit when reviewing the major controversies from the war over  tactics, strategy, and war guilt, where he examines the different schools  of thought with an even hand. Sometimes his hand is too even: on some  topics, particularly when discussing the question of why trench warfare  degenerated into such bloody, futile slaughter, I wanted Holmes to be  bolder in naming names.But these are petty disagreements with what is a  very successful attempt to summarize the events on the Western Front.

The scenery is breathtaking as is the romance, but the love scenes.......wooooowee they are hot! This story has such a great balance of romantic love as well as sensual lovemaking.

Good luck to the parents of teens who flock to the vampire fantasy. This will educate them in matters for which they are just not prepared. I'm very disappointed.

629925,Heartfelt exploration of counterintuitive motivation,"In this sequel to his bestseller, Predictably Irrational, Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology and behavioral economics, returns to the how and why of human beings' inexplicable thought processes. Through a series of telling, small-scale social experiments, he attempts to quantify such unquantifiables as how satisfaction in work becomes nourished or destroyed, how people value their attractiveness and the attractiveness of others, how humans adapt to adverse or positive circumstances, and how to make pleasure more enduring and annoyances less upsetting. Those who read Ariely's first book might have the context to better appreciate this one, but he doesn't seem to hold anything back as he explains his traumatic physical injuries and the lessons, both painful and joyous, those experiences wrought. The author's warm, direct, compassionate tone, and his willingness to share his frustrations and discoveries, lead getAbstract to recommend this insightful, easy-going tour of the irrational side of the human psyche.",5,1
4887081,Superlative secret agent guy!,"Wow.  All I can say is Wow!  This book takes off like a rocket and continues at mach speed right up to the last minute. Lots and lots of twists and turns, lots of fake outs and lots of super duper secret agent stuff.  If you love a good mystery and love a good spy story, this one will fill the bill.  Tim Stevens has done a masterful job of developing the characters and making you like even the bad guys a little bit.  Not all the heroes live, not all the bad guys die.  Definitely going to get the other three in this series and then go after the rest of his work.  Couldn't put it down.",5,1
830589,A very readable and fascinating book about brain research,"I have been intellectually enthralled by this book, which describes case studies and research about our brain's amazing capacity for change, growth and adaptation.  So many books about the brain quickly become tedious reading to the non-neuroscientist, but this one continued to keep my interest and curiosity through every chapter.  I have recommended it to everyone I know who has even a mild interest in how the brain works.  So much of what I learned about the brain back in college is so obsolete and often wrong, so this was an important update for me.  This book offers a great deal of hope to people with brain-related disorders and injuries -- and normal aging.  I cannot recommend it highly enough!",5,1

1541628,Wish it came with pictures of the works of art and historical sites.,Enjoyed the story very much. A real page turner....the plot twists kept you guessing who were the good guys and who were the bad guys right up to the end.I wish the book came with pictures of some of the works of art and the historical sites. Sometimes I had to stop and google them to satisfy my curiousity.It was easy to imagine this book as a movie.,4,1

Great book to read to your spouse or that special someone in your life.Thanks for a hot read Amelia.The bunnies and I give this book 4 carrots.",4,1
1538957,"Like most sequels, this one is bigger but not better","I feel like a jerk saying this, but I really didn&#8217;t enjoy Daniel H. Wilson's &#8220;Robogenesis.&#8221; It had some moments of decent action, but I found it very disjointed and frustrating to read due to plenty of repetitive and boring prose.When your most sympathetic character is a lumbering robot whose only ability to communicate is an &#8220;intention light,&#8221; there is something missing from the book.That thing is heart.I truly enjoyed &#8220;Robopocalypse,&#8221; but this book had much more in common with Wilson&#8217;s other fiction novel, &#8220;Amped,&#8221; which I also did not care for. I was very game to read this sequel, but based on how &#8220;Robogenesis&#8221; ended, it appears this will be an ongoing series, and not one I intent to continue reading.",2,0

1213772,this is a nice read,Cormoran Strike is adorable. I especially liked the way Mr. Galbraith describes his characters. And the plot thickens more and more along the way. The end is quite a surprise. I wonder if Mr. Galbraith would also be capable of writing books for adolescents,4,1

6347582,Nice,These slippers are very nice.  I think this style is true to size.  Other Daniel Green slippers are a little small.  The only issue I would say that I have is that the Ruby color led me to believe they would be more red than  burgundy.  That is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.  I would think you could wear these outside of the house if you wanted comfy  &#34;dinner shoes&#34;  that were flat.,4,1

Ellie is an ordinary woman doing an extraordinary job of keeping her family safe and fed under trying circumstances - well, the end of the world as we know it.  And all without a truckload of MREs, ammo, and a bugout bag!  Stay-at-home moms really do more than lay on the couch eating bon-bons and watching soap operas!

4198145,Another Cute Super-Heroine Series,"I really don't know what made me want to pick this series up.  Normally, any shogou manga never strikes me as something I want to buy, but perhaps the cat girl on the cover had something to do with my interest...Anyway, the series is your standard super-girl style storyline with the interesting charateristic that instead of simply using a transformation amulet to put on a sailor suit, they instead change into animals (albiet in an extremely low key way).  All in all this part of the series is standard, however, what I beleive this series has is a very interesting plot-line that evolves from the characters having animal DNA in their system and no longer being truly human.  Its a very nice catch.  There is an anime for this in Japan currently, and is being released in fansubs.  If you enjoy this type of super-girl anime I would also reccomend looking into a series called Azaukin Cha Cha.",4,1
529096,I loved this unique and funny tale!,"This is one of my all time favorite books!  Favorite scene?  When Agnes has hid all the roofing nails and gunpowder under her skirts! Laughed out loud!  The many scenes of precognition were awesome, too!",5,1

Asher has such an awful childhood and when he meets Natalie he meets his match.  She helps him with all of his demons and he slowly but surely falls in love with her.  So much to get over and in the end they have their HEA.  Loved Asher &#34;Ghost&#34; Collins and Natalie &#34;Nat&#34; Kovac.  This was the 2nd book for this series and I liked better than the first one.  Next up is Max's story and that should be just as good.  Thank you Belle, you're awesome.",5,1

However, this does make it a bit easier to control the mouse without the cursor flying around.* Logitech doesn't offer Unified Receiver software for Linux, so if you're a Linux user, you'll need a third-party package.  I'm currently using ltunify, but Solaar should also work.  Both are available on most distros' repositories.",5,1
5379641,riveting,"I always love reading a book that discusses a topic in a slightly different way. Cathy Glass's stories of children she has fostered nearly always touch on the tragedy of abuse whether sexual or physical or emotional. This story explores abuse of a much more insidious nature that is not immediately apparent but when it becomes obvious and explained it is quite horrifying and just as damaging and difficult for the little girl to recover from. This is also a story of the sometimes redemptive power of good therapy and therapists to enable a father and daughter to be reunited and to raise understanding that sometimes reunification is possible and people can turn their lives around and address the underlying issues that led them to become unfit for parenting at one time. I found this book engrossing, riveting, disturbing, enlightening and ultimately heart lifting.",5,1
4266995,Return of Imaro,"The beginning of this collection of excellent short stories begins just after the end of the first book. Imaro is in pursuit of the kidnapper of Tanisha when... well, that would be telling and I would not want to do that.The book is very well written and Charles Saunders love and affection for the characters and setting and the genre itself all shine through. He admits to editing and rewriting parts of the stories included in this book to make them fit the story arch that he had in mind., Having never read the original stories themselves I cannot compare the two. However in this book it works well and it really does form a effective and engaging story line.If you enjoy Sword and Sorcery fiction or even if you are looking for a fantasy story set in a mythical Africa then this book may be just what you are looking for.",5,1
6794232,He thought it was great,I bought this for my Grandson for his birthday.  He wanted to replace his stock Ford P/U speakers.  I decided on these after reviewing the specs of competitors within the price range.  Infinity out-performed the others.  Apparently it was a good choice as he is very satisfied with the sound quality.  I read reviews that stated the bass was not low enough but he is happy with them and has no desire for a sub-woofer to supplement the quality.,5,1

4192749,Finding Amelia,"The book is a good chronicle of the last flight, and what is (and isn't known). While there isn't anything really new that hasn't been covered before, the book is a good compliment to others previously published on the Earhart story. The focus on (mis)communications highlights the thread of errors that lead to the tragedy. The inclusion of the disc (a nice touch!) containing the source data allows the reader to draw their own conclusions.",4,1

Don't know how to better say it than that.  The ideas expressed in the man - machine interface were beautifully descriptive and accurate.  My work background has been in computer user interface and the author has done his research and described it well.The description of Amish life, culture and thought processes and the interplay of ideas between the world view of the 'English' and the Amish was insightful.  The conflicts of the main characters romance was enjoyable to consider.  The plot, with its twists and turns kept me wanting for more. I hope that there is a sequel in the future.Thoroughly enjoyable.  Well done Mr. Bunker!",5,1

I find it very cheap of them to charge $50-$60 for a tiny little chip, but fail to include a case that only cost them pennies. I like to use a sharpie to write on the case noting what is on that particular card.  You can't really write on the card itself.  Then I store them in a zippered wallet.  The only cases I could find locally were connected to each other making it impossible to put into my storage wallet.  I had checked all of the office supply stores, electronic stores, and discount chains -without luck- before I thought of Amazon.  Anyway, I bought 10-pack of these and now I have a few extras on hand for future cards.",5,1

And then they found them again at the lodge in the poachers bag.  When they found them the other baby that had not been stolen was already grown and when this book finished the baby that was already grown went back to Sam's mountain and looked for a mate.

2208430,Good novel written by the Ghostwriter,"After learning that this novel is not based on any notes left by the late Virgina C. Andrews but solely is the ghostwriter's novel alone, it makes what came after this series and the Landry series as well, a let down, having seen how badly he has done by recopying what was in the Cutler series into the new Hudson series.  But this is a pretty good novel. Will hold your attention from page one until the final end although, like with Darkest Hour, everything seems rushed to a fast conculsion. But otherwise, it's a decent novel.",5,1

So why not release a Live Album??? Almost every company has done this either too soon or too late. In this case too soon. There was no Unreleased or Never-Heard-Before-Songs (Not even one!), So for those who already had her First Four Atlantic albums wasn't in a hurry to go grab this one. The backing band is so-so, as always her vocals shine throughout....But must of us was waiting for the next Studio Project or even another 'Live' that was worth talking about (Later we got the ""Live At Fillmore West"" project that was worth talking about!!!). So just to add to your collection for the purpose of saying ""I Own It""...get it, but to go the 'Extra mile' looking for it....That's another story.",4,1
5301323,Absolutely adorable!,"What a brilliant little book. The artwork was amazing. So vivid and colorful. And the story was brilliant, chock full of adventure and fun, all put to rhyme.

In fact, as she is just learning to read herself, she pointed out the words she knew while following along.This is the second book we've read together of Pat Hat's and I must say that each one is more impressive than the last. This author makes reading fun, which is exactly how children's books should be, especially when used as a means to draw our children into a lifetime love affair with reading.

480438,"Good, but definitely more emphasis on character","This book was good, starting enough after Sabriel left off to be less of a continuance of that story. Unfortunately, this story ends right as the plot begins to take off.  I really enjoyed the descriptions of the characters, though, and there is definitely a twist.  Also, Nix brings charter magic more into the story than he did in Sabriel, so that was exciting.  The book isn't boring, though it becomes frustrating at times because of the slowness or the fact that you want to read more about Lirael.  I couldn't put it down, but I desperately wanted to start reading the sequel to it, so if you're one of those people who get into a story and won't rest until the story is done, wait until Nix writes the next one, because this story has no real ending, just a ""Sorry folks, but that's all we have for today"" type thing.  And that was the most frustrating of all.",5,1
8775405,"GREAT FILM, BUT HORRENDOUS TRANSFER TO DVD","&quot;My Man Godfrey&quot; is one of the best of the 1930's Screwball comedies, hence the high rating. It would have gotten five stars, but the  DVD is taken from an incomplete dupe. The results are, to say the least,  virtually unwatchable. Hope is on the horizon; Universal has struck new  35mm prints from the original negative, and it's playing right here in  Philly. Hopefully, after the cinema reissue, Universal Studios wil finally  do right by this movie and release a pristine DVD(and VHS for those who  still only have that).",4,1

2413045,It'll improve your Multiplayer Quake Frags,"This book delivers exactly what the title indicates.  US Officer Lester Grau interviews many Afghan Mujahideen who fought the Soviet Aggressors during the early 80's.  Out of those interviews Grau wrote three books, This one being the second (with Ahmed Jalali.)The book is broken into chapters like Raids, Ambushes, Defense etc... Each chapter has many individual ""stories"" or debriefings of the mission/situation.  The Muj go into detail on what happened, who got shot and who didn't.  As you progress through the 200 odd missions, you start reading a definite character to the overall war...All in all, as a non-military person, I found the book fascinating, entertaining, and above all educational.  The diagrams for each mission are very helpful allowing the reader to visualize what happens in each battle.Overall, If you are interested in Guerilla or Afghan warfare tactics, I would recommend this book.",5,1

Nothing here is rocket science, just simple, straightforward tips on topics such as working, and treating others how you want to be treated yourself; often this comes down to just plain and simple manners - sadly lacking with some.A good book, clear and easy to read.

The reader can practically see the white breaths in the cold, hear the crackle of dry snow under the feet.A bit too much horror for my taste, but that's just a personal preference.Unlike so many recent authors, the story spends its reader's time unrolling the plot, revealing the actors and the actions, delineating the surroundings WITHOUT padding the book with page after page of endless descriptions of minutiae, as has become so fashionable in the last few years, creating 500- and 600- page monstrosities.

505861,God's grace at work through a humble man,"&quot;Just as I am&quot; reveals the grace of God, illustrated by the life of Billy Graham.  Graham is refreshingly honest and humble about his life's purpose and God's will. His life is evidence of what a human is capable of if he/she lets God take control.It's an amazing testimony of one man's journey from a humble farm boy to an international preacher. As a political science nut I was fascinated by his interactions with so many US Presidents. Billy Graham has truly influenced the path of our nation, and therefore, the world.Yet this book is careful to point out that his success is not due to Billy Graham, but God working through Graham's life.  Everyone who reads this book must consider the &quot;Hour of Decision.&quot;  Billy Graham's testimony demands that apathy is not a choice in the decision regarding eternity.",5,1

An author that, a couple of months ago I knew nothing about, now has me hooked. I loved Slade&#8217;s story in Slade: Captive To The Dark but Blake&#8217;s story is utterly amazing.So HOT  So INENSE  So RAWI couldn&#8217;t put it down. The writing is great. The details are gritty. And the passion if fierce.This is a crazy story of a man so full of good and yet so very evil. It&#8217;s a story about accepting who you are and embracing it. It&#8217;s about not letting things that are out of your control determine your life.The bond between Kaitlyn and Blake is so powerful and raw that you will not be able to put this book down. Blake&#8217;s intense feeling for Kaitlyn left me in utter aww. He was a mix of pure tortured evil as well as gentle and protective.I absolutely loved Blake and Kaitlyn&#8217;s story. If you are a dark romance and BDSM lover then I would definitely recommend you pick up this book today.",5,1

1028848,Gotta read it!,"What happens when you take the main characters from two separate series and throw them in a book together? A masterfully woven tale that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Brandilyn Collins has taken Chelsea Adams from an earlier series (Eyes of Elisha and it's sequel Dread Champion.) and put her into the fourth book in the Hidden Faces series with Annie Kingston. Oh, yes and I would be remiss to not mention the spiders... can you say, ""Give me the creeps""? This book rocks, just like the rest of her books do.",5,1

1910548,A Different Approach,"Very often, books written by Nobel laureates in physics tend to overindulge in arcane philosophical arguments. Some topics discussed are so far removed from the average scientist's day-to-day reality to the point of being comparable to someone's unrealistic abstract nightmare. However, this book is quite different. The author remains grounded and presents his science as something much more tangible. Although some philosophizing is unavoidable, there are also various anecdotes that add a nice personal touch. The writing style is engaging and the topics are varied - within the realm of physics and physicists. I would recommend this book mainly to scientists and science buffs.",4,1
1062952,Definitely a page turner.,"Molly Murphy is definitely an interesting woman. This book is very well researched, you feel as if you were there. The author has given us a fascinating story of a young Irish woman's flight from justice on an immigrant boat, her first look at Ellis Island, the Statute of Liberty and New York City. You can feel her excitement and fear. The adventures,troubles and Molly's unique personality make for a great story and you can't wait to see what happens next. Beginning friendships, murder, political corruption, betrayals and finding your way in a new country, this story has that and more. I can't wait to see what Molly does next.",5,1

It's git s story. A edge of your seat story that takes twists and turns and keeps you guessing. It's always great to read a book chock full of hotness. An alpha male with a dirty mouth. A girl whose life changes in the blink of an eye. It means nothing though without the story and this is a don't miss. Your going to love Vaughn. Want a Vaughn of your very own. He's great on so many levels but also a sleaze. Never give up on Vaughn though because he's got Keely. A independent, naive to some things, hard working, fiercely loyal and loves with her entire being female. Do yourself a favor and don't miss these books You won't be sorry.

5815186,Catchy yet still undefinable,"I first heard School of Fish on the local alternative radio station - Three Strange Days was playing and it struck me as haunting, familiar, yet somehow fresh.  I taped the CD from a friend that had it, but eventually  grew so attached to it that I had to go and buy the CD myself.  It is a  great album for guitar lovers and for those who like reflective lyrics with  a touch of angst.  There is a tiny sliver of punk in the mix here in the  singer's voice and the edginess of the guitars - just enough to keep it  from being relegated to the dreaded 'pop' status.  For those who are  looking for Big Buzzy Guitar, pick up Human Cannonball, which is more  in-your-face, but still a great collection of melody and lyric genius.  Both are well produced and recorded which helps them get better with every  listen.",5,1

6658763,Don't Buy The Magnavox TB110MW9A,"I bought two such Magnavox TB110MW9A units.Hookup was simple: I disconnected the antenna from the TV and connected it to the 'Antenna In' jack of the TB110MW9A. Then I connected the supplied cable from the TB110MW9A's 'Antenna Out' to the TV's 'Antenna In'. I turned on both the TV and the TB110MW9A and switched the TV to channel 3.Things seemed to have gone OK while the TB110MW9A went through initial setup, including scanning. But then, it started switching off the RF output (resulting in total ""snow"" noise on TV) in random intervals (every 30 seconds or so), for about 15 seconds or so, then switch RF back on.This, of course, was not very usable. I decided to try the second box and... it exhibited the same problem.I RMA-ed the boxes to Magnavox for repair/replacement. It took them more than 3 months to return... a different model! (RTB100MW9). To me that smells like a design flaw... Stay away from this model (TB110MW9A).",1,0

It's powerful enough to run games, but efficient enough to last a day at work.I need a computer for my job, and this does fantastic work. All of my programs run very well, and I can get a full work day in on the battery. The trackpad is responsive, and I can't get enough of the touch screen. The S7 is also incredibly thin and light.

I was shocked to discover that the rest of the album was even more promising.  It's too sad  that none of these songs were released as singles, this band deserves alot  more credit.  There are two lead singers with two totally diffent styles.  One creates a beautiful pop sound and the other a more mellow atmospheric  sound.

6258459,Not really worth the money,Bought two of these for the summer as I work out and swim a lot.  Decent quality but they are the low end of the Champion line.  Like another reviewer mentioned they almost sheer when held up to the light.  There is no inner liner and the material is thin.  I also don't like that the draw string is made into a loop instead of two formed ends like the ends of a shoe string.  I had to cut mine and I'm sure they will fray.Due to the thinness of the material I'm not sure I want to swim in these?  Better deals out there for sure.  Walmart sells Starter gear for 10-12 dollars.  Much better stuff.,2,0

I personally like the idea that, as they say in The Terminator series, &quot;the future is not set.&quot;  While Corbin Bersen's acting may not be top of the line, he's actually not the main character and does a reasonable job as a father whose son has been kidnapped.  I can't say much more about the storyline without giving it away except, of course, that it has a happy ending.  This movie is in no ways hard SF, and those looking for it will not like the movie.

I continually draw insight into my own life and how I approach the world through his works.  We are all on 'The Hero's Journey' and it is when we hear and accept the call that we begin to truly become alive.Campbell may have started as the foremost authority on the myths of the world, but he ended as one of America's most insightful philosophers on what it is to be alive.

1732043,Stuart Hill's Awesome Adventure,"Very few books have me ready to give 6 stars if that were possible, but this quite lovely book does just that.  Though slightly formulaic, Cry of the Icemark has endearing characters, excellent dialogue, and descriptions that wash over the senses with ease without describing every rock and bug in the Icemark.  I'll be the first to admit I haven't read much about Were-folk and other creatures, but I doubt I could have chosen a better introduction.Ha, I mainly got the book 'cause its cover was pretty (though different than the cover on this version).  However, it was so nicely told I will probably read it again in a year or so.  I will definitely buy the sequel, though the young heroes will have aged some 17 years in that time.***Addendum, I'm listening to the audio version of the book. It's been so long since I read the story. Many props to the narrator. At first, I had doubts about her voice, but 11 CD's in, I find it very fitting.",5,1

1023195,What could have been?,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel.  When it comes to sports there are always those storylines of &#8220;what could have been?&#8221; when someone&#8217;s career is cut short by tragedy.  In this particular case it came in terms of a rising star getting blasted by a fastball to the head, tragically cutting Joe Castle&#8217;s career short before it ever really started.  But the real underlying plot for this particular story revolves around Joe Castle and Warren and Paul Tracy&#8217;s lives post incident.  Warren, the perpetrator of the beanball has always insisted that it was an accident.  His son, Paul, on the other hand does not buy into his father&#8217;s antics.  Paul, being Joe&#8217;s biggest fan at the time of the incident, believes the throw was intentional.  Now, with his father sick, he is determined to find closure for all parties included.  It&#8217;s a great story that any Grisham fan should check out.",4,1
5560767,Claimed by the Elven King (Part 3) is an excellent read!,"I'd already read Parts 1 and 2 (borrowed from a friend), so I had to buy Part 3 to continue the story.

I cant wait to read the rest of the story!  I'm a dedicated J.R.R. Tolkien fan, so I love the elvens in his books.  Sethian in this story reminds of Legolas, as a result, but much better because he's more &#34;alive&#34;.  The stories are an intense romance, but their underlying premise is believable.  I think she's laid the ground work well for the first half of the overall tale.  I'm sure the King's jealous Queen will make her presence well known in the 2nd half.  I'm certain she'll be livid with jealousy when she learns that Emily has become pregnant, particularly &#34;so quickly&#34;, as the King noted in Part 3.

9079543,A Spoof with lots of laughs! More like 3 1/2 stars,"This flick is a comedy that will entertain a lot of folks, especially those who like Steve Martin. I personally hated the original Pink Panther versions with Peter Sellers from the 60s, and this time around I only went because of Steve Martin. I wouldn't call this Pink Panther a remake, but instead it is its own movie. It's a phantastic comedy and Steve Martin shines. Sure there are all the predictable funny mishaps but there are also quite a few new ideas to amuse the viewers. Basically you can forget about the storyline and things like that, because it's not really about that, instead it's about a 90-minute slap-stick flick and comedy show so to speak. The film barely makes the PG rating and it should be more like PG-13 although there are only a couple of scenes that are at issue. Fact is that it's a funny movie and my wife said she wants to own it on DVD once it's released on DVD. You can take your popcorn and relax as you watch this comedy, and my guess is that most folks will enjoy themselves.",4,1

6314418,Excellent inexpensive smoothing boyshort,"I'm between sizes, and according to the size chart need the larger of the two -- this results in fairly light control.  They smooth nicely and don't smooth away curves you want to keep.  If you're looking for firm control, then since they run a little big, it might be more effective to go a size down.  The boyshort is a great idea.  There is almost no control in the boyshort part which is genius, it really does go a long way towards eliminating lines.I'm quite tall (5'11) and these come all the way up on me with plenty of clearance.

Nothing is pushed or forced here. What makes this cd stand out from all the other bubble-gum pop offerings, is the fact that under the surface of bland simplicity, there's something really addictive - shiny sonic details that stick in your head.

For this M9P headphone, I've tried all the supplied ear tips but none of them were able to keep the headphone in my ear.  When I push it in my ear, it'll just eject itself out.  I'll have use my breath to moisten the ear tip and put it in so it stick better to the ear canal. But if I move my head, talk or eat, it'll come loose.In term of the sound quality, I found it inferior to the apple kit headphone.  The base is strong, but the mid is muddy and the high isn't clear enough.The headset functionality was the reason I chose this pair of headphone from MEE, but because of the isolation feature, when you talk, your own voice gets very loud and it is just weird.  But maybe it's how it is for isolation headphone..",2,0
8947161,Shirley's farewell to Fox and her childhood,"This film is a priceless good-bye to and from Shirley at the Fox Studios. The film uses clips from her very earliest efforts to portray her toddler self all the way up to the current story of an orphan (what else!) who is adopted by vaudevillians Jack Oakey and Charlotte Greenwood after her parents die of something when she is a baby. All three yearn to set up a ""normal"" life on the farm her birth parents left to them. Of course Shirley must win over the crusty, mean-spirited local townsfolk in order for her family to claim their rightful place in the small town life they crave. Oakey and Greenwood are smashing as Shirley's parents; their talents literally ooze from their performances, and Shirley is poignant in her good-bye to her status as the most outstanding child film performer of all time. The fact that Shirley could hold her own with the two scene-stealing old showmen is a triumph! Don't miss this underrated Shirley Temple film.",4,1
7534497,Insulated and durable,I like this a lot.  I also use it to make tea since it keeps things hot for a long time.  And it is strong and durable.  No worries about camping or sailing with it.  I can make two huge mugs of coffee in it which means the second mug (or 3rd or 4th cup) is still hot.I was also worried that the coffee would get bitter even with the plunger down.  It doesn't seem to happen though.  It really is just a no-brainer to get a french press that isn't glass.,5,1

It had great pictures for the most part and amazing video quality, especially for a camera so small.My main complaint was ease of use, but that's hardly even a complaint because all you have to do is read the user manual a bit.

3337449,Dragged a Bit,Tom Kratman relies on the &#34;interlude&#34; a bit too much in this installment of the Carerra Series. I kept waiting for the big battle between the Tauran Union and poor little Balboa and it never happened. Just a lot of Amazons get chopped up and sacrificed for a greater strategy never made clear. This is most likely a way to drag the series out another 2 or 3 novels but I want to read and 'see' more than hints at the overall strategy Patricio will use to defeat the Taurans. I'll admit I am impatient but I would be happier if the series stopped jumping around so much. I am 20% into Come and Take Them and finally realized the book started prior to The Amazon Legion although it is billed as a sequel. Would have been nice to know that or have it explained early on.All that said I enjoy Kratman's writing and this series.,4,1

8793306,A JOLTING EXPERIENCE!,"Although this film may not be as effective in the shock department as it was upon its release almost 35 years ago, it's still a thriller to be reckoned with...........A doll containing a fortune in heroine is planted in Suzy's (Hepburn) home while an incredibly elaborate and sinister scheme ensues.  A gripping tale of a blind woman being terrorised in her own apartment builds up into a frenzied tale of GENUINE jump-out-your-seat suspence! - this is actually one of the first films of that evasive and unique genre........  As the cat and mouse game gets going, Suzy proves to be an elusive and formidable match for Arkin and company........... I distinctly remember seeing this movie at the State Theatre in Woodland, California at the age of 7, (1967). The scene where practically the whole audience jumped off their seats IS jolting and (obviously) unforgettable!",5,1

It cooks evenly and well, and is just a great pressure cooker.We were trying to find a pressure cooker that would last and this really was a great choice.The only thing that I sometimes find annoying is trying to close it!  My wife doesn't have a problem but for some reason sometimes I don't line it up right and can spend 5 minutes trying to get it shut.  I guess someone just needs to show me how to do it :).*Edit: We've had this 4 years now and still no problems at all.

Michelle's real stories about faith (or lack thereof), childhood beliefs (and misbeliefs), motherhood (and motherhood &#34;failures&#34;) leave no doubt in the reader's mind as to her authenticity in all things. While she drew me in with her humor, her message of hope for those who have questions about their faith (don't we all?) brings intrinsic value to this skillfully woven story.I gave my first copy away...and I never do that.

The best part of the movie is the first 5 minutes with the earthquake with the bicycle rider. It went downhill from there.They say if you put enough monkeys in front of typewriters and gave them enough time, the complete works of Shakesphere could be written. The show 10.5 would rate about 16 monkeys and forty five minutes to knock out, so long just for length.Was there anything postive. yes, the bike rider, the Goldengate bridge going down and the end credits (it was over).

3118792,Kept interest throughout,"Meg Whitman's foreword set up this volume well and made me feel like this book would be as interesting as the product summary suggested it would be. Rebooting Work was very interesting, easy-to-read, and engaging.Maynard Webb possesses a rare ability to actually talk about himself and the work he has done (in the context of framing a point) without actually tooting his own horn or treating this book like a long-form resume or history of accomplishments. The book also avoids becoming peppy with a ""sell"" about following your passions and abilities if you want to become truly successful and content. While it makes these points, it feels more authentic and engaging. Again, I believe all of this can be contributed to Webb ""walking the walk"" as well as talking the talk.I read this book in a day and have revisited select portions of it to think more about the points Maynard makes. This isn't the exercise in redundancy one would expect since the text is very conversational as well as informative.",5,1

I'm pretty sure that the 4 people we read about will be in ""Mortality"". We get to see how they cleared the zombies out of the High School that they will be staying at in the next book. We get the feel of what these people went through and how hard it was for them to survive.I really enjoyed this short story very much and I know that ""Mortality"" will be amazing.

3011024,Is AntiChrist a coming reality?You bet He is-you better not take his mark!,"Excellent read-from a pretriber till 1992 Id say that this is the smoothest and most concise read of most of the prewrath books.Alan details all the major components of this period soon to be upon us,in a smooth and detailed way.I highly recommend it for all believers,if only to soften your position to being open to other positions.Being prepared they say is half the problem--so please be!Pretribers have to force the greek exegesis and have no solid basis to expound this position.I was actually scared into the kingdom by the fear of being left behind.This is a careful rendering of the texts of Jesus in Mathhew and Luke,Paul in Thessalonians and John inhis Revelation.All agree and coincide with the correct timing of what an actual parousia really is--not just a flash in the fan--you re out of here---the folks left behind will have a sad lot to deal with-Please dont take the mark of the beast-enjoy the rest of your eternity with the one who gives life.Excellent choice Id say.",5,1
3766143,Crime / Trial Novel from the Bench view,"Most crime novels, a la John Grisham, focus on the defendant, the prosecution, or the police.  While there are elements of these three viewpoints, it is refreshing that this novel concentrates on the judge of a high-profile , gang- and drug-related murder trial.  The story starts fast, continues its pace, and has a neatly resolved conclusion.  The author's expertise with the law is clearly evident.I have two reservations - the plot resolutions are almost too neat . . . ALL the loose ends are tied up, and this would rarely happen in real life.  Also, the inclusion of an historical, 19th century story involving hanging of two Irish immigrants as the result of a clearly flawed trial, while interesting in its own right, does little to advance the the novel's story. The old story is a cautionary tale against the death penalty, but most of the novel is already slanted in that direction.",4,1

8950280,What Ties These Three Stories Together?,"Not much, it is way too subtle for me to understand what these 3 women's lives and stories have in common. This is one of those films where you appreciate the magnitude of your problems compared to the characters' as theirs are 100 times worse than yours. I might have appreciated this film more if it had focused on one of the women and only told her story.Why does Kyra Sedgwick's Delia stay with a man who despises her and have 3 kids with him? How about Parker Posey's Great going from also ran editor to superstar - is it really that easy? Why is Fairuza Balk's Paula out in a club and interested in the Norwegian dude? Each one of these could have used more backstory.Ron Leibman's Avram Herskowitz is an obvious ripoff of Alan Dershowitz.Rebecca Miller directed and wrote the film based on her book. This movie looks like it was shot on tape in an eternally smoky haze - was that the only way to ""soften"" these characters?",2,0
8358537,Beautiful Story,"Robert and Jane were the epitome of complicated. They each brought their own baggage to to story and they each blamed the other.

1229598,A nice twist to the fairy tale,"This is the well-known story of a princess whose evil stepmother tries to have her killed. The huntsmen could not go through with it and tells Snow White to run away. When she does she finds herself in the company of seven small men.  They live in a house very happily until the queen finds that Snow White is not dead.  She finds Snow White and tricks her into eating a poisoned apple. Snow White dies. She is awoken from her death by the kiss of a prince and they live happily ever after.The reason I enjoyed this version of Snow White more than others that I have read was that is was not as much of a fairy tail like story and more of a darker approach to it. The seven dwarfs, for example, are not shown as happy little creatures that sing and dance all day long.  They are merely shown as small, kind men. The illustrations in this book are so beautiful even though they are not the bright colors that would usually go along with this story.",5,1

Angel has come home to his father, who works endlessly to discover ways to prolong the lives of others, through medical experimentation.

2926926,Gritty,"Sharp, dark with a drug-induced dystopian flare, Katja is the story of chemical dealers, druggies and dreamers, all on a quest to escape their island prison. An unconventional collection of anti-heroes and antagonists, it's remarkably similar to the gritty tales of Sonja Blue by Nancy A. Collins. It's a toss up whether the sheer violence wins out over a theme of the struggle to find a better life. But it's all good, dark and fast paced, like being stuck in a trunk during a drunken joyride. Recommended for horror collections looking for something outside of the same old authors and styles.Contains: violence, language, drug use",4,1

8476365,"Short, Sweet, and Oh, So Hawt!","I had the honor of receiving an advanced copy of this anthology, and my review is for Secret Obsession by Olivia Linden:This sexy short is perfect for an afternoon &#34;quickie&#34; or a pre-slumber delight. It packs a powerful punch of erotic, sensual, and some may even think, forbidden love. Finn and Sylvia are not just star-crossed lovers, they're step brother and sister who've been secretly lusting each other from afar.After a chance encounter when Sylvie gets a flat tire and Finn pulls over to help her out, they cave in to the pent up lust they've been harboring since their parents got married. Their encounters and secret rendezvous are filled with such intense eroticism that as the reader, you'll feel like a voyeur observing these two lovers succumb to their forbidden passion. It ends on somewhat of a cliffhanger leaving the possibility for a full story of the fallout of Finn and Sylvie's revelation. Great job Ms. Linden!",5,1

But this worthless crap isn't even worth my time. All I have to say is watch out cause I am sure they will start remaking Slumber party massacre! Now dont get me wrong those showed their fair share of boobs and sex, but it didn't normally last long....a remake of that will no doubt be hard core porn and the whole point of the movie is gone!!

She offers advice to the person sitting on their couch thinking about starting their novel straight through to those working on selling their completed book. One chapter I found very relevant in today's publishing world was her chapter on self-publishing. I think it makes this book a must have for most writers.

6586462,Works great.  Priced really well.,"I have about 9 switches in my house, scattered about the floors and rooms.

Wireless is used only for laptops and tablets.I always search for good values in network components.  I've started using TP Link products in the past year, and have been quite pleased with their value, and this switch is no different.  Its built nicely, it works fine, and its a good value.Gigabit Ethernet switches have become a basic commodity, and prices have come down.  At this point, there's little difference between most switches, as they are extremely basic devices based on a single computer chip (most made by the same couple of chip manufacturers vendor).  The differences are in quality of assembly and cost.  And this device is well worth the price",5,1

4146533,Classic Jeff Cooper,"This book is a survey of handguns as weapons of personal defense--exactly how Jeff Cooper saw them.  It goes through the history of the sidearm from its beginning as a weapon carried in a saddle holster to what was at the time of writing a new development, the double-action self-loading pistol.  It is classic Cooper in the strength of the opinions offered, but it's also interesting to see how much he was willing to change his views when he learned or created new ideas.  The chapter on fighting with a handgun comes before the Modern Technique that Cooper spent decades teaching.  The book is dated now and will appeal mostly to Cooper fans and to those interested in the history of firearms.Review by the author ofA Draft of Moonlight",4,1

Yea, the critics hate it.  So what. Some of them hated Star Wars, too. We love it.  Our kids love it.  Our grandchildren love it.  It's still on TV five decades later, and now it's on DVD and Streaming video, and still going strong.  It's good, old fashioned fun, and great humor for the whole family.  Something that still gets us laughing nearly five decades and umpteen reruns later must have something good going for it, right?!",5,1

1568575,A classic on the history of the Pacific War,"As far as I know this is THE classic on Japan in World War II (at least for those of us who don't read japanese), in the same way that William Shirer's 'The rise and fall of the Third Reich' is on Germany. As such, this book should be the starting point for anyone who wants to read about Japan in World War II, and maybe also for the Pacific War in general. This book deserves more reviews (like William Shirer's book, which anyone can see is a classic based on the number of reviews), but I guess most people who read about World War II are interested in the European theatre. A point of notice to those who are mainly interested in military history: The book has a slow start. The first 200+ pages is dedicated to everything that happened before Pearl Harbor, all the diplomacy etc. Once the war starts however, this is pure military history, and you will see that it was worth getting through those first 200 pages.",5,1

The sequel &quot;At San Quentin&quot; has a considerably different character. Folsom Prison, however, must be THE place where Johnny Cash really wanted to perform.

1857318,getting better,"I think the author may have hit her stride with this one. Yes, I was as irritated as heck at Ethan (though, darn, he somewhat redeemed himself before it was too late, no?). But this story was pretty well woven, I thought. I didn't guess who was behind the shifter dodginess, which is good because I like to be surprised. Though, as bizarrely as it might sound because I know the cutie from gramps office can never have Merit, I almost feel a little mad about him getting a potential girlie shofter to settle down with.To be honest, I think that's pretty much all I have to say on the matter. I really liked the story line. I thought the emotions in this were handled really well.

977329,I waited too long to read this book...,I should have read this book years ago when I was in my adolescent years.  This book is phenominal in every aspect.  Anne's writings are beautiful. She wrote well beyond her 14 years of age.  She was saturated with wisdom.  This diary focuses on the beginning of their ordeal living in the attic in hiding from the Germans.  It goes into great detail about everyday life spent living with a number of individuals in a confined space under hostile circumstances.  Anne goes from child to young women in her diary.  It is a great read for every age group.  It allows you to appreciate your environment and to be thankful for what you have. .,5,1

His books are filled with fascinating ideas and philosophies, and this book is not an exception.I can only imagine what life would be like on Luna. While this isn't happening now, Heinlein makes it sound believable, from what he reveals to us of Loonie life, and the philosophy also makes sense. This book is also full of practical knowledge and commonsense, and it seems that our own government could learn a thing or two from this book. It's also a good romp as a simple sci-fi novel. I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you like sci-fi and philosophy, you will too. If you're not really into either, then oh well. :)",5,1

She's like the friend you wish you had while going through pregnancy, birth, and the first few years of your children's lives.

2250525,An enjoyable read!,"I have read many books on George Patton, but so far this one is the most enjoyable book to read. It is not a definitive biography, nor do I think it was written to be so. This is just a concise yet detailed description of Patton from beginning to end. Patton was a master of the ""one liners""; yet eloquent at the same time. He could be cruel yet tender, brave but yet emotional, an inspirational leader yet full of self doubt.This book seems to be the inspiration for the movie, because almost all the scenes are described in this book. Yet I noticed the movie is based off of a book by Ladislas Farago. This is an inspirational story for everyone. George Patton struggled with dyslexia in his youth, but through his self-will and detirmination he willed himself to exceed. A great American story that is a must read!",5,1

If I'm out in the yard, walking the dog, at work, etc. I like the behind the head style. First, you don't get the ""oh, you had headphones on"" hair... and it is also much less annoying over time.What I like: The Phillips SHS8200's produce very good quality sound; are comfortable on the ears; fold easily and nicely so that they take up little space; and they are attractively priced.What I don't like: There is no adjustment for size (typical of this style unfortunately). So, they might feel a little big or a little small, depending on the size of your noggin. It's a relatively minor complaint however.",4,1

8615214,In a word: Brilliant,"David Fincher hits the nail on the head with this one. The tension does not let up, and just builds on and on, slowing down to an almost unbearable climax.Fincher is evidently a skilled director, and he is lucky to work  with skilled actors as Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey who is  terrific in his role, giving Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter a run for the  money. Gwyneth Paltrow is in this too, as Pitt's wife, but her role is a  discreet one. One could say she adds the air of feminine beauty and grace  to the movie, a pleasant change to a constant tension  build-up.Congratulations must also go to Howard Shore with his beautiful  and exquisite music, perfect for this movie, even when the credits show up  the tense atmosphere is still somewhat hanging around densely, because it's  David Bowie with his strange &quot;The Heart's Filthy Lesson&quot;.

Zondervan likewise offers Nave's topical bible index in the back of their version (minus the verses), plus miscellaneous charts.  Both of these  versions are equally nice to have.ANY version of Strong's is a must for any believer, in my humble opinion.

After I became annoyed doing that, I decided to take the plunge and buy a kit like this. I'm so happy I did! It comes with several different tips, most of which I use. It comes with both reusable and disposable piping bags, and I find that I can reuse the disposable ones if I wash them thoroughly enough.

1865521,"Bewitched, Bothered and Biscotati:  A Magical Bakery Mystery",This is a delightfully fun new mystery series.  The characters are people you'd want to be friends with and you can just taste the treats on the bakery shelves.,5,1
3226646,0 stars,"This book provides an interesting look into the Islamophobic world of Christian fundamentalist ideology.  The fact that the back of this book contains a positive review by Walid Shoebat the con man and pretend ""former PLO terrorist"" (who fleeces money from people to give lectures on his non-existent ""PLO terrorist"" past and spread hatred of Islam )  is telling in and of it itself.",1,0

7576377,Fabulous Glass Pitcher,"I wanted a glass pitcher with a wide opening so it was easy to clean by hand and I did not have to use a bottle brush.  This pitcher is perfectly shaped, easy to handle, nice thick glass but not too heavy when full, and holds over 1/2 gallon.  The lid can be &#34;dialed&#34; to create an airtight seal, but I generally just pop the lid on without tightening and it does a good job.  Glass is the only way to go for health reasons and I love the clarity of glass.  I use mine everyday for iced green tea (Good Earth Green Tea With Lemongrass is so good!) and I absolutely love it!  Sometimes it's the small things in life that give me the biggest thrill and this pitcher is one of those things!!",5,1
8516399,Awesome!!!!,"Where to start!  It's hard to believe I could love this book even more than Fighting Temptation!  I loved Jules and Jaxson, but Sawyer and Grace..... Sawyer is so swoon worthy!  I was constantly smiling or laughing while reading this book!  Sawyer would practically have me in stitches with his personality and demeanor! Grace is so sweet and strong after going through the terrible events that happened in her past!  If you loved Fighting Temptation then you will definitely love Sweet Temptation! Cannot wait for the next book!",5,1
5755124,"""Patience...and ye shall be rewarded!""","Todd Rundgren (a ""true wizard"") with Utopia created a ""true masterpiece"" way back in 1974. First off: the 3 songs preceding ""The Ikon"" were...""great"". I will move on to the ""meat"" of this ""album"": ""The Ikon"". It was hard to believe, but Todd compressed and put this entire masterpiece on side two of Utopia's debut VINYL album, clocking in at (an all time ""record"" on vinyl) at 30:22. Due to compression, the sound did suffer...but not all that much. Here (in all its glory) is the entire ""masterpiece"" from the master tapes.The musical piece, ""The Ikon"" (in itself) was a progressive rock masterpiece.The climatic ending with all the interwoven themes from the 30:22 piece is absolutely PURE GENIUS.(Have any of you ever listened to any ""Classical Music"" by the ""Masters""?);-)",5,1

9075265,One of the very best pilots ever.,The pilot on this show is one of the best ever made - from PAUL HAGGIS who made the movie CRASH - it's a mind-blower.  The 2 eps they included are great episodes but not at the level of the pilot - now that blu-ray exists - why not just put the whole series out there?,5,1
1688802,Improves on the first book in every facet,"Shadow Ops: Fortress Frontier by Myke Cole is the highly anticipated follow up to one of our favourite novels from last year - Shadow Ops: Control Point. Fortress Frontier is a highly impressive sequel, one that addresses the issues readers had with the first book whilst improving on all the things readers loved about the first book. Replacing Oscar Britton with Alan Bookbinder as the primary protagonist for this book was a bold move by Cole, but it as also a necessary one, and to Cole's credit it was executed almost to perfection. For fans of military fiction or high action fantasy, it is likely that this book will be one of the best you read all year.",5,1

Varying from discussions on positive thinking, to dressing smart, using goals, and overcoming the fear of failure, there is something for everyone in this book. Highly recommended.",5,1
1529046,A survey of American grammatical standards and how they are being influenced by both other cultures and media,"Deserving of ongoing mention is a fun companion to the PBS TV special which stands well on its own and promises lasting lending value: a survey of American grammatical standards and how they are being influenced by both other cultures and media. The authors co-wrote THE STORY OF ENGLISH, which was a historical overview; DO YOU SPEAK AMERICAN shares the discoveries they made while interviewing native speakers and observing everyday verbal interactions. A fascinating account evolves.Diane C. Donovan, EditorCalifornia Bookwatch",5,1

9228750,The Vampire Curse,"Problem with this episode is that its just a compilation of various scenes from the original episodes and leaves out much of the details of how you get from one point in the story line to the next.  It is very disappointing.  Having seen the tv version and then watching this rendition of the tv series.  I would have to agree with the previous review that the ""Dark Shadows: The Vampire Curse"" is not worth your money.  Do not buy it as you will be disappointed if you have seen the original series as this rendition has been butchered so badly that it leaves big holes in the story line.",2,0
1158945,Patterson Loses Touch With Reality Completely,"the blurb reads ""a Russian monster ""The Wolf"" and another psycho ""The Weasel"" control tactical nukes located in four major cities and the dysfunctional Alex Cross is assigned to save the world""does this sound like an old comic book, a bad ""B"" movie, something even worse? if so it's probably the latest James Patterson book, written to a level that would be emabrrassing to most other authors;  can't we just chip in and send Patterson a blank check every couple of years so he doesn't embarrass himself again",1,0
2355628,Disappointing,"I was surprised to find that I didn't enjoy this, because I'm usually pretty easy to please.  I don't expect too much from cozy mysteries, and this is a typical cozy mystery.  The problem, I think, is that I simply didn't like the characters.  I found them all a little abrasive, not very happy, and just rather unpleasant. I just can't imagine spending any time with them in real life.  That might be okay for some books, but a cozy mystery should be an escape, and this was one I didn't want to escape to.  (Obviously, this must be a very personal thing as others seemed to have really enjoyed this book.)",2,0
757696,A Little Heartbreaking,"Shirley Jackson wrote this (her last book) as her psychologist was working intensely on her agoraphobia. It reads like a woman coming out of a funk and for Jackson, that really works! It's a really wonderful book of stories, including the one that first aroused her husband to stalk and date her. The entire book is excellent, but it always strikes me as incredibly unpleasant that her widowed husband put this collection together with his NEW wife and then dedicated it to HER! Shirley surely turned over in her grave on that one.",5,1
1401836,Great book,I really enjoyed reading this book.  It was very inspirational. I would recommend this book to a friend.  I would like to read more books by this author.,5,1

5894709,"Not a very good album, and Beyonce is still conceited","I'm not a big fan of Destiny's Child, especially since the other two girls left the group.  I'm not fond of Beyonce either I just like her name.  Beyonce is too conceited for me.  She reminds me so much of Diana Ross, you would think that she's related somehow. She takes over all of the songs, you hardly ever hear Kelly or Michele and I think they have beautiful voices whenever Beyonce will let them sing.  I don't own the new album but I did hear sample songs from it, and I don't like them at all, except for &quot;Survivor&quot; and &quot;Bootilicious&quot;.  Until Beyonce comes down from her high horse, and let the other girls sing a few songs or more I'll continue not to like them.",1,0
2716347,This play comes off like a breeze.,"It's completely relatable generation to generation.  When you grow up you sometimes forget what it was to be a kid when your parents were out with their friends having the entire conversation over your head even if the conversation was about.  Here we see what it's like when the kid grows up, but is still the kid technically.  No one really listens to him or values his contribution, they just love him and that's enough to make the dysfunction tolerable.  A fun play to read, watch, listen, and remember how you were made to feel like this guy.  Most of all, it has great roles for older actors.",5,1

I was a great continuation of the series and I'm looking forward to reading the next one that comes out in June. Karen shows how you can't always believe something you were told most of your life and you have to be able to accept the truth when it is right there in front of you. Even when it means your family will turn against you, disown you, you can be strong enough to do what is right. Great book!",5,1

2071553,Good overview of contemporary hermit life,The author of this book is in a unique position to write about this topic. She has lived as a hermit and is now editor of a quarterly newsletter for hermits.

3192087,What Am I Missing?,"Love, God, and the Art of French Cookingleft something to be desired.  Maybe more about French cooking and God with a little less about the author and his failed relationships. Those promised ""hints on how you too can become a Master Chef"" are just not there.As I continued reading through the book it felt more like the Author was patting himself on the back for trying to discover why relationships fail??????  The best part of the book was the moments when Rodger, the Chef/Mystic was allowed to show his wisdom.This is the first book I have read from James Twyman and I was not impressed.  I found the book to be less than enjoyable and difficult to finish.",2,0

And now I'm so pleased that it was the same movie and again, sorry it's over. So I'm buying it, because it would be too hard to explain to my friends.

I too am from Landenberg, so I figured I would support a local. I had to write and tell you that this is one ofthe BEST books I have come across in a very long time. I cannot put it down and I think about the characters when I do. I stop in amazement at times, that a story like this can come from someone's imagination.  It is truly a masterpiece.",5,1

2813328,A superb journalistic mystery,"Hip, young journalist, Alex Bernier and her co-workers at the Gabriel Monitor have seen their fair share of excitement. But nothing like the ""frankenfoods"" debate.When protesters at the local university gather to protest genetically modified food research, Alex is on the scene to cover the demonstration. What she didn't count on was having to report that the school's agriculture building exploded and that a prominent university spokeswoman had been beaten to death in her lab.Alex also didn't count on having to solve the murder mystery herself.Using her widely acclaimed Gen-X writing style, Beth Saulnier takes an issue from today's headlines and turns it into a fast-paced, thrilling mystery. Alex Bernier is as fun and irreverent as always as she wades deeply into the politics of protest and the corridors of university power.A great addition to Saulnier's catalogue.",4,1

It doesn't have HDMI and only one Component HD output.  So naturally we needed something to allow us to plug in the latest technology, a blu-ray player we purchased.  The Switcher works great.  We've had no problems and I personally don't notice any degrading of the quality through the switch.  I would certainly purchase again before buying a new television when ours is still working great!  The only draw back, no remote.  You have to get up and manually make the switch.",5,1

4533763,A Wealth of Information,"As a first-time author and fledgling book promoter, I found a wealth of information neatly heaped in this frugal package.  The book is like a smorgasbord, so laden with tender morsels that one can hardly wait to taste a bite here and a bite there, allow digestion, and then go back for more.  I especially enjoyed experimenting with the Amazon Perks explained in Chapter 32, but the entire book is loaded with careful guidance from an inspirational lady who has learned by trial and error and is willing to share her knowledge of things that work.

While this story was really well done and the hot factor between Cassie and Alex was through the roof, it was unnecessarily long, causing me to skim a lot after the halfway point and to be the length it was and end in a cliffhanger for a concluding book is a little frustrating- I feel some fat could have been trimmed and fit in the end in one book. However, I did enjoy it and will definitely read the next one because I have to know the fate of Alex and Cassie now!!!",4,1
612632,really stupid,"this book has two major flaws:1. silly denial of historical timeline - Tzar Nicolas' daughter (anastasia) is a young woman in contemporary times, with a 3 year old son?? The Tzar's daughter's lover is 33 years old?? This book creates tension between contemporary politics and leftover Tzarists with a disregard for the evil Lenin and Stalin. I appreciate fudging historical facts to tell a story, but leaving out a huge chunk of Communist Soviet Union is lazy, not creative.2. abundance of cliches substituting for competent writing --""three story victorian painted a lovely shade of pale yellow....decorative gingerbread geegaws and doodads,""...""the sun rose over siberia, ascending into the blue heavens...""

QE deals head-on with the weirdness of quantum mechanics that a lot of books seem to intentionally avoid.

The main character decided that she wants a gift as well so she tries to think of how she could lose teeth. From her understanding, eating lots of sweets could make her teeth fall out. Because of this thought, the book completely switches the story line from wanting to lose her tooth to get a gift, over to how eating lots of sweets makes your stomach hurt. After quite a few pages about eating sweets, the story all of a sudden transition back to the young girl getting a loose tooth and getting a gift all on the last page.The book is cute, the story simply loses focus throughout the middle.

There was nothing to grasp on to, no part of the story that made sense or read well. I ended up skipping most of it simply because it was hard to read.Skip this one it is truly a waste of time.

6681509,A Big WOW!,"I purchased this unit recently from another seller at a better price, but at any price this is a receiver you'll have no regrets about buying. It's a beauty! It's one of the few stereo receivers available that gives you quality, style, and plenty of power to push inefficient speakers. Most of the manufacturers these days are focusing on the home theater market and building elaborate units with bells and whistles but not necessarily quality. This receiver looks great, sounds great, produces pure stereo power, and will bring a smile to your face. At $400 or lower (you can find it for $299 if you look hard enough), it's a smart purchase. I'm grateful that Harmon Kardon recognizes the need to offer a simpler, stylish unit that focuses on stereo sound. I love it!",5,1

The story is a good one, esp. if you read it in partnership with Hoover's other book about her move to the woods, The Years of the Forest, and tells the story of how she and her husband moved to the wilds of Minnesota in middle-age and what (and who) they found there.  The Gift of the Deer introduces us to Peter, Mama, Pretty, Friendly, and all the others who live in Hoover's &quot;neighborhood&quot; deep in the North Woods.Oh - and why is it great to read in the summer?  Because her stories about the bone chilling cold of Minnesota winters are just right to balance the August heat and humidity!",4,1

And let me also include that I thoroughly enjoyed J. Michael Straczynski's work on Amazing Spider-man when I was in college.  I thought Superman: Earth One was a fresh take on Superman.

At times I was moved to tears,  literally -- while commuting on a subway.  I was enthralled with the  author's &quot;voice&quot; in telling her own sad, victorious, heart  wrenching story from childhood through adulthood.

I don't know why this was changed.Bottom LineThough the new itrip is aesthetically nicer, it's functionality is subpar when compared to it's predecessor, the 2006 itrip.  Another example demonstrating that a newer version does not necessarily mean better.",2,0
3145069,"Includes ""filler""","This tale does not have an even rhythm (for want of a better word) - also there's is a constant danger of losing the reader's interest caused by having to wade through page after page of extraneous `filler' and some plot irregularities.The author tends to ramble on interminably about irrelevant information like architecture or the furniture in a room; but then say (for instance) that a character `had a drink' - of what: water, whisky, hemlock?There are some indiscriminate grammatical errors like erratic use of the apostrophe (i.e.: the plural of Cadillac is not Cadillac's), and this may be a little more contentious, but: not `round the corner', `around the corner'?STILL - gave it **** though - it keeps the reader interested.....",4,1
1925920,Insightful and Instructive,"Bill Isaac has an amazing gift for cutting to the chase and explaining in the clearest terms and without condescension  the core issues in the banking world to those without financial expertise.  His explanation of the events of 1980's crises (when, as director of a key federal agency, he was at the table) and current ones are compelling and instructive.  You'll learn far more than you will from reading our leading periodicals and listening to most of the talking heads.  The cliche about those who don't learn being doomed to repeat is certainly true in this financial arena, and Isaac's diagnosis is a must read.",5,1
5602264,Very fey,"From the cover to the delicate Rose to the entire storyline, this book is very fey. It's like peeping through the veil to a life of shadows, shades, demons, angels, witches and other entities within our own world. Ms Swallow's style of writing and her use of the recovering Rose for a first-person perspective only serve to emphasise the ghostly feel of the story.There's no cliffhanger here - the book drifts to its natural end, though leaving events open to make way for a sequel or a whole series, as I understand will be the case. This had a nice balance of paranormal to romantic elements - I'd go as far as to say it's more urban fantasy than romance.I enjoyed the story and I look forward to reading more of this series.",5,1

864414,Questions of identity,"A gripping novel from 2000, re-released in 2010, offers a bizarre twist on identity. The ""counterfeit son"" is Cameron Miller, 14-year-old son of Hank Miller, serial killer. When his ""Pop"" is killed in a police shootout, Cameron claims to be Neil Lacey, a victim supposedly murdered by Pop six years earlier. The third-person narrative hauntingly depicts the realities of post-traumatic stress. Tension rises steadily as Cameron/Neil struggles to escape Pop's shadow. The clues are in place, but so deftly blended into a tense emotional drama that it's difficult to determine the truth until a life-threatening climax lays bare all of Cameron's--or is it Neil's?--secrets.",4,1

The author, William Landay, does a wonderful job combining the investigative and courtroom drama with the more significant human drama that plays out.Highly recommended.",5,1

I learned while studying this book to let go of some deep past hurts. Hurts that I thought were already gone, but were really bubbling under the surface. This is a great book if you are willing to dig deep into your spirituality with an honest and open heart. I thank Beth for writing such liberating words based in scripture and for caring about people's hearts.Studying this book moved me to new levels. My life mission is to foster continuous learning, growth and to inspire people to truly tap their God given talents. Beth's book is one very useful tool in this process for people.",5,1

It reveals too many members of the curia are uncommunicative, self-serving and generally judgmental of those who they feel are iinferior: women, lay men and children. The hierarchy is depicted as pretty much like many other human men searching for prestige and self-satisfaction. I won't go into the scandalous behavior that all too often has been deliberately overlooked by too many of the curia. Shame, shame..Mr. Thavis reveals time and again the outrageous behavior of those who have been called by God to serve but choose instead  to demonstrate a charade of Christ's teaching.I suspect there are those who would label the book, &#34;anti-Catholic&#34; but I think otherwise.

Complex characters and moral dilemmas are staples of Card (and Johnston).

There are many memorable listening experiences on this album such as, ""Cry, Cry (Til the Sun Shines Baby), the comical ending number, ""Knocked Up"" which could be a 2009 rendition of the classic Loretta Lynn ""One's on the Way"", and of course the top 15 single, ""Johnny & June.

3486556,A good page turner for the beach,"This book was enjoyable even though the main character had so little insight into herself and others (and she is a therapist!) that the reader could see plot twists coming way before they actually took her by surprise.  It was a great read until the end, I would have rather the main character did not find another man so soon as is implied.  Women need to learn to be strong on their own and for most of the book she was working toward just that.  I hope in a chapter never written she just remains friends with the man down the road and becomes a famous advocate for women, as a result of her bestselling book.  Haha!",4,1
8080119,glad I read book 2- really picked up,Glad I went on to book 2- the story gets better and better. Twists and betrayals make for a great read. Get past book one and it falls together!

8837774,A Must For Ken Russell Fans,"Even on tiny budget Ken Russell manages to create a visual feast and something entirely unique.  This is not for everyone, but if you love this director's work as much as me --- it is a must have.  Russell's narration  is fantastic!  If only they will have him do this for The Devils, Women in  Love and Gothic we are going to be all set!",5,1

8579144,The Hidden,"It's very violent, but I really liked this DVD.  I had owned it once before as a VC and was delighted to find it was now on DVD. It's not suitable for under 16---that's my opinion, of course.  When people are shot, torched, and stabbed, they're supposed to be dead. Since some of the characters continue on in spite of what has happened to them, I don't think those under 16 may remember that it's just entertainment and not real.",4,1

2768894,An amazing start to what will hopefully be a great series,"I liked this book.  I liked it a lot.  I thought the concept was good, and Wendig did some really interesting things with it.  But man, it was dark, bleak.And that was really my only problem with it.  Without at least a moment of light, the dark becomes humdrum and it starts to lose its power.  Miriam's life is unrelenting awfulness.  Whatever moments of joy she finds are immediately tempered by horror, by violence.  There is a point in the book where we actually see hope for her, where we see something that brings more dimension, where maybe for a moment we can smile.  And that moment makes me so excited for Mockingbird.So why, with my complaints, am I giving this 4 stars?  The writing was terrific.  The pacing good, and the characters, for all the darkness, were layered.  I cannot wait for Mockingbird, which I've already pre-ordered.  I think this is going to be one hell of a series.",4,1
629060,Funny as H*ll,"Great book! I picked this up thinking it would be a good Father's Day gift, and ended up having to buy myself a copy as well. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. I laughed out loud as my kids gave me funny looks. The book is a collection of humorous stories that remind the reader that no matter what, your dad loves you: even if he does embarrass the hell out of you!Growing up in a military house, I could relate to the brutal honesty and colorful language without any offense, but I would recommend to those whom are a bit more sensitive be wary of the purchase. While the book isn't a long read and can be finished in one sitting, it is still a worthwhile break from more serious reading. If you are like me and read more than one book at a time you will welcome the comedic break it offers.",5,1

I think I'm going to be in this state for the next few days to be honest. I wasn't quite sure how I felt at first, but by the third or fourth chapter I was hooked. I was laughing, I was crying... I was an utter wreck. I knew Olivia. I empathized with her; with her choices, with her self-destruction, with her self-preservation. Oh my God! This book was torture; it was so real and true to life that it was painful. It evoked such feeling in me, and it's obvious in other reviews that I'm not alone. I will absolutely recommend this book to anyone asking. I need a stiff drink and a few days alone to collect myself after that read. Phew!",5,1
2608559,LOVE IT!!!,"I have always loved horses and this book is perfect if you want to read about horses. It even had a little bit of romance to, always a plus.

I've come to love it and am starting to sell my skills.  But I've been needing a good reference book, and I found this one at a used book store and knew I HAD to have it.  I bought it for a reference, as it has such great, detailed instructions for every kind of sewing task.  But I found it's so helpful that I'm reading it straight through.  I haven't even finished it yet, and I feel like it's improved my sewing already.  I'm devastated to see it's out of print, as I am going to tell all my friends to get it.",5,1

6864446,Very functional Keyboard,This Microsoft keyboard was automatically recognized within windows 7 and the software to configure the buttons works great. I would recommend this for gaming as well due to the contoured W key and the back lighting that is blood red. It has S1-S6 function keys for in game play that are easily programmed. Overall I am extremely pleased with this purchase and would rank this as high as some of my higher priced keyboards. If you can get this keyboard under $50.00 dollars then it is a must have . I hope this review ultimately makes up your mind when choosing a reasonably priced keyboard that truly is not cheap and does what any PC enthusiast would need.,5,1

8788989,Smacks with Glory,"If you are a student of movie history you will enjoy this rousing Tyrone Power vehicle that shows some history with fanfare. I don't doubt it is relatively accurate in historical fact. The movie is colorful, buoyant, and follows the life of one man, Pedro de Vargas, played by Power. Mostly filmed in beautiful regions of Mexico, it has good camera work. Good directing, and a good sprinkling character development as well. In the beginning we see his wealthy family in Spain and then it being crushed by the Spanish Inquisition. It follows the mother and fathers escape to Italy while Pedro, with two friends along to help him, head for the coast. They join Cortez in the fleet heading for the Indies and a assault on the indians of Mexico. The movie is ripe with nationalism and although may be upsetting to some, it nonetheless tells a somewhat realistic message of conquorers like Cortez. Good quality DVD with extras and decent replayability. This can be purchased as part of a set of classic movies here at Amazon.",4,1

1379178,Yet another good book by this author,"I really liked this book and because there are so many summaries I'll just say that I like the way the author writes. I enjoy the fact that she leaves the sex to our imaginations but not in a prissy way. This story was realistic and deals with 2 very difficult but diverse topics; rape and dyslexia. She dealt with them well but without depressing the heck out of me. I think although I did get annoyed with the h towards the end because of how she pushed the H away, it was realistic. I really can recommend this book.",4,1

This is a fast-paced romp through high-level corruption with Reacher, as always, just a step ahead of his own early demise.

Whereas the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People brings a person from dependency to interdependency, the 8th Habit brings it further from interdependency to leadership. It very nicely ties it all together. I would highly recommend this book, but only to someone that has either read or taken a workshop to internalize the 7 Habits material first. This book is worth reading but only as a sequel to the original.",4,1
7265017,Great Low Cost Option for IPod/IPhone Charger,"This clock radio may not be sleek looking, but it has a lot of nice features.  I loved it. The price great and offers some nice features.  If you don't want to spend a lot of money, you can't go wrong.Cons:- Doesn't have a ""fashionable sleek"" design- Doesn't have a battery back up- I live in Florida and get many thunder storms.  At times, the electricity is temporarily interrupted. Because this unit doesn't have a batter back-up I need to reset the time.Pros:- Compact - Fits nicely on any desk or night stand.- You can charge your iPhone/IPod WITHOUT removing the protective case.  I love this feature- Has two wake up settings.  You can set the alarm to radio or alarm.- Nice sized Snooze & Sleep function button.- Audio in-line so you can play music from your IPod/IPhone- 20 Programmable Preset Stations for the FM Radio.- Charges iPod/IPhone quickly.- Nice clear sound when you use the FM radio.",5,1

475124,Always True to You,"I've read everything published that Valerie W. Wesley has written and I truly enjoy her imagination and the way she portrays her fantasies through her pen. All of the other reviews adequately describe the storyline which, I agree, is not drama filled. The story itself was just plain, simple and quite enjoyable. As usual, I started on a Saturday morning and was done by Monday morning. Very quick and light. The most important lessons of what love is really about are the areas the author has chosen to explore in this novel, as well as how our relationship with our parents determine what type of parents we will become. Quite interesting !!! If you're on vacation and looking for a nice pleasant short story, you've got to read this.",4,1
2005674,"Emily Rubin's STALINA Encourages Reflection, Appreciation Of The Little Things","With the hustle and bustle of the world we sometimes forget that there is more that matters than what is right in front of us. In author Emily Rubin's Stalina we see the world through a young woman who wants to be a part of something bigger than where she is from and might be expected...and she does just that.Written in first person so the reader can travel along the way with her, Stalina encounters the harsh realities of life no matter where she might go, but that doesn't mean there are not good times to be had and enjoyed along the way. With hard work and dedication she showcases that anything is possible. There are also instances throughout the book when we are reminded that no matter where we are there are more things that might unite us than divide us.Beautifully presented with heart and true feelings, Stalina is a triumph of not just the American spirit but the good within us all no matter where we might be.",5,1
5923914,Best since 'Falling',"Easy this is Dion's best album since 'Falling into you'. The French-Canadian Diva last attempted the ecletic album style on 'Let's talk about love' and failed miserably. Let's face it there were three good songs on that one. But she, thankfully, pulls off the ever so risky 'eclectic album' with a wise form. Instead of trying to do every kind of music there is (only dabbling in hip-hop for her backgrounds) she instead shoots for what she can do really well. The original version of 'A new day has come' is classic Celine. While '10 days' gets an almost Eric Clapton feel with its Folkiness. Other songs like 'Right in front of me' are tramendously modern Pop proving that classical training can easily outmatch the bubble gum 'natural talent' of Britney Spears. Plus Celine's cover  of 'At Last' is gorgeous.",4,1

This book provides a scholarly overview of angels in the literature of several religious traditions, and incorporates some of Shapiro's theological/spiritual views on the non-duality of God.God is everything, and everything is God, therefore angels are simply an aspect of the God phenomenon.  In truth, angels are different aspects of human consciousness, variously attuned to certain elements of God consciousness.As in all of Rabbi Shapiro's books, he takes a rather simple formula and consistently repeats it; he does this, however, without resorting to simplistic formulations.  Reality in all is messy complexity is presented for us to shift through.",4,1

The pages used are extremely thin, which, although allows for a lighter and slimmer Bible, reduces the opacity significantly. This allows text from the back of the page and the page underneath to show through and interfere with your reading. For me this is not a huge problem, but for those with reduced eyesight it could be a issue. Everything else, however, is excellent about this New American Bible.",4,1

Nurse Allison wants to get involved with Jamie but knows that the &#34;other shoe&#34; is going to fall and he's going to try to send Samantha back to the mother who abandoned her on his back porch. She doesn't want to be involved with either one of them but she can't help herself.This book had me giggling right up until that shoe dropped. At that point I was a blubbering idiot.

Mike, the author, is a person who, along with Roselle, helped people descend 78 floors of steps in the North Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. I learned much from this book. First, Mike helped us understand that the blind are more capable than we realize in taking care of themselves and achieving success in many of the arenas of their lives. Second, guide dogs are extraordinary companions who work hard for their owners. Roselle's temperament was docile and sweet. This was an asset in her important work. But these words do not really describe the impact of the book. It is powerful when the aspects I mention are seen together. With THUNDER DOG you'll find yourself saying, "" Oh you must read this book...""",5,1

Haunted Georgia details various haunted locations around Georgia, organizing the locations by city and type - creating a handy guide for someone to use if they are in Georgia and want to check out some haunted locations. Georgia is naturally teeming with (controversial)history and many of the historical structures exist and are still in use today. The author provides excellent historical background on the locations and descriptions of the hauntings, all with humorous commentary. I have heard of many of these hauntings (Savannah is particularly famous, as the majority of the buildings in the historic center are haunted), and can attest to the haunted rumors circulated by the residents described in the book.

Quattermain has appeared in a number of books. filims, and serials, but this story marks his first.King's Solomon's Mines tells the story of the elephant hunter as he journeys in search of a secret kingdom, to recover a lost treasure and find a missing man.

It was partially exposed pointed directly up at the balloon. It was so cheap this was a ""bonus camera"" if it worked. At 100K feet there were 100 MPH winds and -50 degrees. The camera was partially exposed, but just taped in. In 2-3 ground tests I could never get more than 90 minutes out of it. In record mode it appears to save to memory every 30 minutes. If the power dies you lose whatever was in cache before the last save. I couldn't get the battery to last more than 120 minutes, so I only got 3 thirty minute files. For the balloon I got 99 minutes. Somehow it got bumped (??) and told to stop recording and it saved the last 9 minutes. We caught the balloon burst with just a minute to spare.

He thought the author made a mistake, actually intending to write that the apprentice writer would have 'more' accidents. The lesson from Mr. Elster concerned the correct use of the word 'fewer' in the sample sentence, instead of 'less'. - - Fewer accidents, not less accidents.

If you are new to Heyer, I recommend that you start here.  Yes I know that this book brings back characters introduced in earlier books but it's fine as a stand alone.  After you read it you will probably want to go back and learn about Terrible Timothy's earlier adventure and what the Inspector was like as a Sargent.  So you can go on to ""They Found Him Dead,"" but read this first.  It's the best possible introduction to her writing.",5,1
1117167,Excellent Analysis of the Problems Associated with the Cult of Diversity,"I've never been a big fan of Pat Buchanan, but I reluctantly found myself agreeing with 90% of what he had to say in this book.  In an excellent repudiation of both NeoCons and Diversity worshippers, Buchanan traces the history of America's ascension and the planting of its seeds of destruction through the extension of empire and the promotion of the least productive elements of society at the expense of the most vital elements.  In light of his views, I am surprised that he doesn't recognize Ron Paul as the only leader able to get us on the right track.",5,1

I love this album, and I bet you will, too!",5,1
8462487,beautiful,I was given this for an honest review. I was not sure how much I would like this just because of the subject matter. I was super happy to be able to review this book.This book was breathtakingly beautiful. The love story between Diana and Gideon was amazing. The thing that I really enjoyed about this book was the struggle that Diana goes through after everything that happens. I really felt this was a very eye opening book. It really showed how one single event can really change a person. When writing about this subject matter I imagine it was a very hard book to write. I really commend this author for really showing what a woman possibly can go through after a traumatic experience like rape.This is defiantly a book that will touch your heart.,5,1

I have no idea why Comedy Central stopped the show regardless comments and requests posted by angry fans on the website.Anyway, previous reviews already reveal how good the show is. No need to address on that issue. One thing that I couldn't agree more is the about the DVD distributor. Like one of the previous previews points out that the distributor did poor job on making of the DVD. No special features, no subtitles, no delete scenes and no add-in values. Compare to those bootlegs DVDs sell on eBay, the only difference is one is legal and the other is not.The season one I just sold is because that. And those poor executions downgrade the marvelous title from a collection to a common DVD. Hate to give an outstanding product 4 star preview. But those who made the DVD really ruined the value of it.Enjoy it!",4,1

In that quest however, what Philippa Gregory left to concentrate on was to create wideacre more appealing and worthy of Beatrice Lacey's evil actions. Instead, from time to time we are reminded that wideacre hall is just one of those ordinary estate of land in the village. Having said that, the author reminds us from time to time Beatrice's obsession with her birthplace and rights denied to women at that time justifying the heroine's conspiracy to murder, incest and all the sin of that time.I have to admit that I couldnt put the book down until I finished the last page.",4,1

5275429,Ok mystery,"I really wanted to love this book. I found the secondary characters (especially Tuesday) more interesting than the Protagonist. The mystery was just so-so, as I had it figured out pretty early. Olivia really wasn't very likeable since I can't relate to someone who is shallow and superficial. She had an unhealthy relationship with her ex who was a horrifying caricature of a rich playboy. Her focus on clothing and name brands made her story about getting away from L.A. seem more like a plot device to get her into a smaller town than her trying to change her life and grow as a person. It was obvious she left because of the ex, and that made her seem wimpy. The Detective she is attracted to seemed dull and lifeless. I am glad I got this for free or I would have been upset by the poor writing and lack of editing.",2,0

I know the author was comparig it to Catch 22, but I didn't care for that book at all.  I know this book is certainly  not for everyone, but anybody who loves a good adventure is sure to love it.

I'm not sure what it is, I'm usually not that big on revenge, but perhaps it is the way all of these very different ladies dish it out while dining on fine china, the best of foods and wines. Of course the characters and plots are outrageous and unrealistic, perhaps that is what makes them so much fun. The Sisterhood can now write their own ticket, even though they are in hiding. The imagination it took to create this group of Vigilantes just keeps on getting better. I usually find myself laughing out loud at least one time per book, usually more.I will say, I'm not sure how this book would read if you were not familiar with the books from the beginning of the Sisterhood series. For me, reading the first seven books would be a must to fully enjoy these latest ones.",5,1

9348540,Prometheus,"This movie ventures into the unknown allowing the viewer to bring up questions that are not intended to be answered. There is no set answer on where the origins of life came from. Fans of the Alien series best not go into the movie with expectations because you will be setting your selves up for disappointment. Ridley Scott did a fantastic job in creating a world that is creepy and at times thought provoking. Too often now films are hell bent on giving the answers to everything when its sometimes better to leave the film up to interpretation. I'm glad Prometheus was a story on its own, rather than being a direct prequel with aliens and face-huggers. The film requires more than one viewing and is best to watch multiple times to get a better understanding of the events that occur. If you go into the film with expectations you will be disappointed and will be cheating yourself to a thrill-ride that we have not seen in a science fiction film for a while. Give it a chance and take it in, you won't regret it.",5,1

I was looking forward to a fresh prospective on Jane Boleyn and hoping for a researched story on her life and why she made the cruel decisions she did. Instead the author follows Tudor cliches and the new insight she added was purely fictional and to me...ridiculous ""I mean come on Anne of Cleves and Kat Howard doing the nasty? Not to mention Jane and **** hooking up."" If I knew nothing about this time period I might have thought this was a fun romp through medieval times, instead this was simply ridiculous.",2,0

First most World War II fiction novels have the main character(s) being a officer(s), not this book the main characters are Sergeants. As a retired Army NCO this made me feel good. The author said at the end of the book the Horton aircraft is real and the German Atomic Bomb program was too. The other thing I enjoyed was the fact that while the two NCO's  and their troops were competing against each other, when it came time for a mission they were one team, as it should be. This makes another of the 99 cent books that to me is much better than many that cost me much more. Since this book ends not long after the Normandy landings I hope the author has a sequal in mind.

Most of the songs on this first volume should probably better be called &quot;postpunk&quot; than &quot;new wave&quot;,  but let's not get hung up on words.  The first five tracks make this album  worth the money alone - Blondie's stellar &quot;One Way or Another&quot;,  Plastic Bertrand's one shining moment &quot;Ca Plane Pour Moi&quot; and so  forth.  The rest of the album is perhaps spottier - hitting notable highs  (&quot;Money (That's What I Want)&quot;, &quot;Video Killed the Radio  Star&quot;) and some not-so-highs (&quot;I Do the Rock&quot;, where Tim  Curry sounds like he's trying really hard to be cool).  An excellent start  to an excellent series.  Odd note - this series doesn't contain the Depeche  Mode song &quot;Just Can't Get Enough&quot; on it...but then again, EMI's  LIVING IN OBLIVION series didn't contain the Anything Box song &quot;Living  in Oblivion&quot;.

The foul language was a little off-putting as well.For a book with a title of Beach Street Knitting Society and Yarn Club, I really expected more about knitting, the knitting group/yarn club and yarn store.

This book is the perfect reminder of how to do it right, how to spend and save money.  We know these things, but we need to be reminded and we need some guidance.  There are also a lot of bright ideas packed in this I didn't know or think of.  Basically, the books paid for itself in the first 10 minutes of reading it.  Thank you.",5,1

2662164,History with the page-turning excitement of a novel,"I read this book very quickly simply because I couldn't put it down.  I'm baffled by the criticism that it's not religious.  It tells the story of Christ's life and what led up to his death.  His life and death are the basis for the world's greatest religion and by sticking to the facts of that, it is indeed a religious account.  The book is graphic and although I haven't read ""Killing Lincoln"" or ""Killing Kennedy"" this book might be too intense for younger readers.  It's on my list of books that I'll be giving this year as Christmas presents.",5,1
5351997,Trouble sleeping at night????,Lots of children are afraid of the dark and need some help to get through the night. Mia&#8217;s Quest for Courage is a cute book that will do exactly that.

I remember reading it in one sitting and being so surprised that this novel drew me in as much as it did.  You easily care for all of the characters in the book and getting to see how the cooking class is a catalyst for change in their lives is delightful!Don't be surprised if this book has you rushing to your stove to whip up some food yourself!

I also was duped by the number of well known actors such as Beverly D'Angelo, Kelly LeBrock, William Katt, etc. I'm not sure if the writers' lives were destroyed by a role-playing game or they simply couldn't think of anything more original than the clich&eacute;'s, fowl language, and hate found in this script. Yes, we all know that every gamer is a virgin, has a dead end job and lives in their mother's basement.If you're looking for light hearted fun, look elsewhere. I can recommend ""Dorkness Rising"".",1,0
1362240,Splendid Sequel!!,"This was fantastic!! Just as wonderful as it's predecessor, The Iron King. I loved where the story picked up. I loved the tension between Ash and Meghan. I really enjoyed seeing some of my favorite, and my least favorite, characters grow in ways I never expected.However, Meghan and Puck's relationship felt forced to me. I thought the struggle between Meghan being Summer and Ash being Winter was more than enough of of a struggle without adding another cog to the wheel.I loved the way this book ended, but I'm really not sure how the remainder of the series will play out now. I mean, I can guess, based on the title of the next in the series (The Iron Queen), but there are so many variables at play that anything is possible!I cannot wait to find out what happens with Meghan, Ash, Puck,and the gang, but I'm dreading the end of a series I've really come to enjoy and love.",5,1

7007397,Exceptional,"I upgraded to this from a Forerunner 110 because I gave up on that watch's fragile (non-replaceable) wrist-band. My only regret is not getting this watch sooner. Using the bezel took a bit of getting used to, but after the first few tries I found it incredibly convenient and intuitive. Satellite acquisition times are noticeably faster than with my 110 even with lots of buildings around me and overcast skies. As an added bonus, the wristband is user-replaceable and it ships with an extra set. Finally, from an aesthetic perspective, the watch is great for everyday use without drawing much attention. Though it is by no means small, it doesn't look out of place on my average wrist either (unlike some of the other GPS watches out there).",5,1

Meow, go grab yourself some popcorn and you go watch this movie.",4,1

2239303,"Day-dreaming, 35 years ago","This book just came from Amazon today so I haven't read it yet. But I  wanted to share with you what I was most delighted with when I opened the  book. I must have been day-dreaming when the teacher taught the rule of Y.  All these years, I'm 46, I never new when to leave the Y and add s, or drop  the Y and add ies. In fact, that rule was one of the reasons I bought the  book. You can imagine how happy I was when the first page I turned to was  the very rule I was looking for--the rule of Y. I can't wait to get into  the section on commas.After skimming through the book, I saw many rules  that I have forgotten, but that, Joanne Feierman, has resurrected into a  fun easy way to remember. I doubt I'll ever forget the rule of Y from now  on. You know, when I think about it, there was probably a good reason why I  was day-dreaming thirty-five years ago.",5,1

This is particularly valuable given the competitiveness of the current job market and the lack of ""replacement jobs"". The jobs we have lost likely will NOT be returning, and a new way of thinking about the job search is critical. This book will help you get there - and the information about re-positioning yourself and your skills to make you a stronger candidate is excellent advice for those searching.",5,1

Among many great tips outlined in this book, it gives thorough information on how to present your best self, how to be aware of red flags that a man is not ready to be in a relationship, and explains key characteristics of what a man is looking for in a mate, etc., etc.! I recommend this book to anyone who is searching for true love.",5,1
627345,cookie,This was a cute and nice christmas love story. I enjoyed seeing the main character declare her love for the guy at his wedding that took guts and even though their time had yet to come.

5783441,Coming of age,"From the first eerie notes of &quot;Scoundrel Days&quot; I knew that this was going to be vastly different than their first album. What is this? All these songs are dwelling on murder, on fear? What else is this? They are making use of a real drummer! Kudos for that! The songs are like no other the band has made. I'm not sure what led the band into the outer rim of hell, but they certainly came back with a macabre, dark treat. Each song has some underlying darkness (if it isn't obvious), yet they pull it off without making you want to off yourself in the end. From start to finish this is a great great record. High points: I'VE BEEN LOSING YOU, OCTOBER, THE WEIGHT OF THE WIND, THE SWING OF THINGS.",5,1
8383981,M's Review,"We were given this book in exchange for an honest reviewCharlie and Callums life was going perfect, at least that is what he thought. Charlie on the hand hated it. She only got the weekend to spend with him and even then he was always on his phone.I knew the whole time he was hiding something.  But what he was hiding was so horrible when she found out. I wanted to strangle him through my kindle. Im glad Charlie walked away. She needed to find herself even though I did think she needed to hear his side.After some time passes Callum finally gets Charlie to listen. When his story is done, I was left sitting there thinking.. holy sh!t did that really just happen? Some of it was a little over the top but I also get why it was so much.Is Charlie and Callum's love strong even through all the turmoil?4 stars",4,1
504242,Almost Like Being in Love,If there was ever a book that deserved more than 5 stars this is it.

5340922,"Original, well-crafted thriller","This is an original and well-written story. It does require substantial suspension of disbelief, but the voice was so strong, I had no problems with that. Unlike many e-books, 3 a.m. is fairly well edited. However, there is one malapropism that diminishes the ""big reveal"" at the end, when we are told who made the all-important autonomous--as compared to anonymous--phone call.The bonus preview of the author's next book was a delightful surprise. And I'm inclined to read it, too.Good, job, Mr. Pirog!",4,1

The ONLY part of this book that held my attention was the end, and it didn't do so for long. I'm now sitting here, kicking myself for forcing my poor brain to trudge through this hogwash. The story is long and drawn out and the writer has no talent. Never in my life have I picked up a book with such monotonous detail, page after page after flipping page, it never changes!

Turned Out From Ethiopia happens to be one of those stories and it is told so well in this book.  Actually, the story is so well done and raw, that it makes me mad.I had to read the book in bits in pieces, even though I could have had the book done in a single sitting, because of the subject.  I think it is written very well though and I like that everything is laid out for the reader and none of the details are smoothed over.  Very well done and I think people need to read this because we kind of just go about our day oblivious to what is happening all around us.",4,1

The hero is kind, but I didn't like the heroine at all.  She had  absolutely no redeeming qualities; in fact she refused to be sorry for any  of the problems she caused for other characters.

But then again, I've never had a complaint from the other end either.  Anyway, I now carry a mini butterfly clamp with me so I can clip the mic by my collar.  It doesn't bother me that the mic doesn't have an on/off switch; I just answer and end calls from the phone.  I mean how far can the phone be...it's not like it's bluetooth.

6299920,Runs a bit small,I had the Cumulus 12 shoes about a year ago in size 10.5W and they were massive (I had to give them away because I tried hard to like them by wearing them for a couple weeks).  This time around I ordered down to a 10W in the Cumulus 13.  They are on the small side.  I wore them 3 times for runs and each time my foot felt crowded and would get tingly or numb- even with super loose laces.  I pulled out the inserts and saw that they were super thick and took up excessive space. It looked like the inserts were an after thought which made these wides into a narrow average shoe.  I dropped in some thin inserts I happen to have.  The shoes actually feel like a normal wide width now!  I've worn them on a few runs and they feel absolutely great now... I don't even think about the comfort of my shoes when I'm running-- which is what I want.,4,1
5480063,thumbs down,I didn't like the writing style of the author.  It felt like she was trying to hard to be sexy and dominant.  The female lead spent to much time talking to others.  The males was closed mouth about his past and that came off as childish.,1,0

The stories of its early days and its evolution were very enlightening and explained a lot of things I had often wondered about. The best parts were the descriptions of the stars, how they came to be and their relationship to the network. Sadly Food Network's treatment of some of its people such as Emeril was pretty shoddy.

I kept compulsively turning the pages as all the sub-plots folded together into the, gradually revealed, overall story.  The background world is just as interesting as the story and Stephenson creatively describes a post-nation state world based on nanotechnology (I suspect that somebody more versed in the technology might have gotten more out of all the technology talk than a layman like me).  One warning, Stephenson doesn't stop to explain the new technology, culture, or terminology.  Rather, he just throws out terms and concepts and everything is gradually explained.  I suspect that some readers could be frustrated by this approach.",5,1

She pretty much jumps at anything that looks at her. I liked the main male character, Dalton. I just had to skip a lot to get to him. This book started with a great premise, but, I only finished it because of how much it cost. I would not recommend this book series to anyone.",2,0
4966051,Fallen Angel/ Five Stars,"Ianni is a fantastic edition to the Past Lives Series. Ianni gives readers a deeper look into one of Avery Snow's closest friends, and brings them on a painful, confusing, and often exciting journey with the newly human, former spirt guide. Ianni is like a child experiencing the world and her emotions for the first time in a very unchild-like body. This novella does a wonderful job of connecting its readers with Ianni's new experiences and feelings, and by the end readers will feel Ianni is one of their closest friends as well. A great edition to the series, sure to leave readers waiting impatiently for the next book.",5,1
1636141,LOVE this book! Original and charming!,"I wanted this book as soon as I saw it and read about the content; what a great idea! Complaining crayons! We go through all the colors in the box and share their unhappiness when they send a batch of letters to their owner Duncan. He reads all of them and comes up with a magical solution which is shown toward the end. Along the way we meet various crayons and read about their individual complaints and though I found all of them to be funny and witty, my favorite was poor Peach who was afraid (and embarrassed!)to come out of the box since Duncan removed her wrapper! This book is simply brilliant and the illustrations are fantastic! This book can (and should) be given to kids everywhere for birthdays, holidays or just because, it is that special. No child should without one!",5,1
4189077,The Bruning Lake,"Ah, rather than the CIA-MI6 type, we have the Russian auslander who attempts to make sense out of the chaos about him. It's a familiar scenario: the world is falling apart and only our hero can battle the elements and save it.  Except this is a bit different, told with a Russian twist.  Well done.  The Burning Lake is the third in the series - all are worth an evening's escapist reading.",4,1

I was irritated enough to have some angst but not to the point of wanting to stop reading all together.  There is a lot of drama and just when you think things are sorted out - BAM - more issues!  But, it is written in a way that keeps you mesmerized and wanting more.  As I said in the review of Book 1 (Fall From Grace) - there is humor, sadness, drama, suspense, romance - this series has it all.  I was ALMOST upset that this the last book because I could have kept reading about not only Shane and Grace but about the rest of the group, but was happy to not have a cliffhanger!  Very happy to have stumbled on to these and hope to see more by this author!",5,1

3953799,Kids love this book,"My daughter loved as I read aloud and read of all Joy's adventures (Joy is the main character) and how he went and helped others act bravely and do what they were ultimately scared to do, but needed to do in order to get what/where they wanted to. What we found, ultimately was that Joy also experienced fear. He was scared someone would not want to be his friend. (of course he was wrong!)This book, full of colorful, unique characters and a myriad of challenges and adventures is a great book for kids of all ages. It is especially good when trying to teach our children to act on courage, or how to be good friends to one another. (there are a TON of learning moments in this book-especially if parent is reading to child!) I highly recommend adding this book to your family &#34;library&#34; and reading this to your kids or having them read it themselves. Through its good example, it is also a great book to read that demonstrates the opposite of bullying.",5,1

Furthermore, the characters are all cold and the audience cannot embrace sympathy.  Thumbs down.",2,0

'The Queen is Dead' is a solid choice for the novice or curious as you will not be disappointed and will desire the next album.  Radio play songs, ala KROQ and 91X, include 'Big Mouth Strikes Again' and 'There is a Light'.  My personal favorites are the title track...The Queen is Dead, Cemetery Gates,I Know It's Over, and Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others.

6062883,Not great or consistently memorable but...,"there are a number of songs her that are really catchy numbers of substance.  What I really wonder about this album in connection with the one they shelved and then released for free on their website is why they didn't just put the other good material with this material making it a solid album of songs instead of a very short one with few good ones.  Those are my thoughts on it.  For those not knowledgable of what they sound like, they sound like a alt-country emo band very similar in voice to the Get up kids because they share the same singer-songwriter.",4,1

I kept turning pages because I wondered, ""What's going to happen next?"" Even the subplot of the book is compelling enough to make you wonder what you would say or do if you were in Joy.I can't wait to go back and re-read my favorite parts.

2166577,Thoughtful and voyeuristic,"This book jumped into my hands a few days ago, and I couldn't put it down. It's not that the plot twists and turns or that the characters are so riveting--though they are, it was just a very beautifully told story.  Soft and quiet, like a stream to sit by, compelling in the most understated way.  I'm not Catholic, but who hasn't been intrigued by the life of a monk?  Growing up on the Canadian border (Buffalo) I was very comfortable and familiar with the French-Canadian theme, if not the religious aspects.  I was very taken by the humanity of these people, not saintly and overly pious as I had imagined.  Not completely sure of their choices and convictions, any more than any of us are.  I simply loved this book and will be sharing it with many friends who may at first glance find it an odd selection.  I highly recommend it not only for the rare glimpse of a rare life it offers, but for the questions it provokes in one's own life.  I will be looking for future works by this author.",5,1

9435842,"Review of the first episode ""genesis""","The first episode of the season is an extremely interesting and unusual bit of television. It simultaniously provides both the beginning and the possible ending of the title character. Richard Boone plays two parts which are essentially his younger and older self confronting each other. Its well written and quite original.The Paladin character is a former west point officer and civil war veteran. He is from an important family but falls into disgrace and is eventually paid by his family not to go home. To stay away. He falls into a life of dueling, gambling and mercenary work. The episode shows the character hitting rock bottom in his youth, confronting his mistakes years later and possibly reaching a sort of redemption late in life. Whats so good aboutthe episode is that explains the character in an allegorical  way rather than a literal one. The answers it offers are meaningful answers rather than trivia.William Conrad both directs and plays a role in the episode.",5,1

4251299,An important contribution to the literature,"So long as 800,000+ people are arrested for marijuana cases ALONE, every year, and so long as those sent to prison for drugs are predominantly black and poor, and so long as court time costs over $1000 an hour, and so long as prison time costs from $15-35K a year, mass incarceration remains a luxury America can no longer afford.Ms. Alexander, Paul Butler, Paul Craig Roberts, and many others have written about the problems with the Prison Industrial Complex, and the way it has destroyed entire communities.

Very little seemed to actually happen, large amounts of it were just re-iterating the same thoughts over and over again.  Several new characters were introduced that, at the time, felt like they just interrupted the story.  The character of Chris, who I liked very much in the first book, was a jerk throughout most of this book and seemed to go against everything that was described in the first one. There were also ALOT more mistakes in this book - grammatical, punctuation, repeating phrases in the middle of a sentence.  I don't know if the author was rushed, or what, but if this were the first book and not the third one I've read of hers, I wouldn't have continued.",2,0

I even tried to convince the office manager at my work to get them for the sink in the break room.Our previous sink strainers had those little plungers, which were always engaging all on their own, which would mean that the sink was always plugged up when I didn't want it to be.

For too long we have been like the church of Laodicea.  We are content and believe ourselves to be rich and increased with goods, and have need of nothing.  We have no idea that we are &quot;wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.&quot; (Revelation 3:17)  We know there has got to be more.  Does it make sense that there is no bread in the house of bread?  Can a living man see the face of God?  It is time to submit to God's way of living.  God wants a personal relationship with us.  Crucify the flesh!  Get out of your comfort zone!  Let your soul follow hard after God.This book appears to be written from a Pentecostal (or Charismatic, if you prefer) point of view, but it speaks of all Christians today.  We must seek a deeper relationship with God.  We must seek His face, not his hands.  Don't let Satan blind you any longer!",5,1

This runs MUCH quieter and at from what I have seen the same speeds.  I never hear the fan go on.  It does not run cooler, however, than the 5870.  I also noticed that if you enable ATI overdrive the idle clock speed goes up to 300mhz instead of 100mhz which seems wasteful when you are not playing games.  I overclocked it by 50mhz on the core and 35mhz on the memory without doing anything, which was nice.  Other than that, you basically will be able to play anything you throw at it that is out there today.  Crysis Warhead still has some hiccups, but the 5870 had them too when it wasn't blue screening.This is definitely the best bang for your buck that you can get at the moment.

In better books these characters are humanized and believable, but they're still either heroes or villains.  This book has a hero/villain too; the difference is that his 'villain-ness' is part of his 'heroism'!  No one but Anne Tyler could have pulled this off, but she does so brilliantly.If you've ever doubted yourself, wondered about your motivations, confessed your sins to yourself and then absolved yourself of them-- then reading this book will be like staring deeply at youself in an ash-colored mirror.",5,1

I enjoyed the historical fiction part of the story as well.,4,1

As expected for L lenses, it is nice and sharp with quick and silent focus. As an added bonus, this lens is nice and discreet compared to the much larger, white 70-200.The only reason I'd caution against this lens is if you need the flexibily of a zoom lens for your particular use case. For my needs, this is perfect.",5,1

2036422,Great Book-graphic parts can make it hard to stomach,"Caleb Carr's The Alienist explores the process of tracking a killer in the 1890's. Without the use of high-tech &quot;CSI&quot; tools, Dr. Lazlo Kreizler is forced to track a killer through use of profiling. Told by John Moore, a writer, the Alienist follows the investigation as the detectives uncover more bodies and more clues to the killer's past and mindset. While I found this book exciting and interesting, It has many graphic parts when describing the deceased and I could see this as being a hard book for some to get through. Overall I liked the book and the characters in it and don't regret reading it.",4,1

There was no childish conversation and not filthy pervert descriptive sex anywhere. Just enjoyable reading material! I want more! There are a few things that were left to the imagination but, I want to read about it. This author threw in twist that I never saw coming! As things were revealed I would shake my head and say, ""no way"", and had to read more.  I did guess the reason for the families disappearance because my situation was very similar.

I had no idea just how brutal and graphic this book is. I shuddered my way through the first 2 chapters and then called it quits.It's just too brutal and too graphic for me. The cruel acts are described in detail and just too out there and vile for me to read.I get that the book is intent on shocking to drive the message home, but it was just too much for me, and too twisted.",1,0
3249700,maybe yes and maybe no,"I sort of liked the book and I sort of disliked the book.First, let me say this is well written and well researched book. I liked that. I was disappointed that the book spent a great deal of time talking about the Golden Age of Journalism. I was hoping for a book that dealt more with Roosevelt and Taft. The ending left me flat. It seemed to just dribble out like the last drops of water from a bottle. It might have been nice to learn if Taft's Supreme Court made any seminal decisions.Don't be alarmed at the size of the book.

2283732,This Book Is On Target..,"This book was never intended to be a Theology lesson on every church out there.  It is a well organized topically given exercise of who the Christian Churches are.  Frome whom were they spawned?  What are their beliefs based on Historical and Creedal Precedents (statements) and that's all it is meant to accomplish.  Perhaps if Mr. Rhodes wishes to make use of some literary criticism whereby some here have chosen to pass on him and maybe in his next version of this book he may choose to give a broader depiction with a better Prologue and Commentary area.  But a book about Denominations is just that.  A book that tells us as factually as can be sought out through preserved data of who, what and where these churches have come from and what do they believe.  No reason for a scholarly lesson on ""is this church' teachings this or that and why or why not"" is needed!  That is not this book's intent.  It is not a Theology instructional manual of The Churches.  Period!",5,1

I am glad I took the leap, because this was awesome to use!  I didn't experience any of the grease or metal flakes that others did. at. all.I DID follow one person's suggestion to initially clean this with vodka, and maybe that's why I didn't see grease or flakes?  Either way, I was happy with the results of the pasta this made, and the ease of which it helped me make it.  The *only* complaint was that the recipes were way off in timing of the mixing of the pasta dough.  I had to run the dough with the dough hook on 2 for almost 8 minutes to develop the gluten enough to roll out right.Overall, very happy with the shipping speed and packaging as well.  This is a well made product that I am expecting to use for some time to come.",5,1

5474033,Firecracker in the making!,I like this installment!  This was an interesting short story on how Trixie was like before she became Firecracker.  Trixie wasn't so aggressive. She was cautious and not so daring.  She cared about not wanting to mess up or ruin anything.  The build up to the very hot parts was really interesting.

My 6 year old LOVES it.  Some mild violence and peril, but all turns out well in the end.  For a second I thought the ending would be too much for a 6 year old.  Maria jumps into the ocean to sacrifice for her family, but within seconds, she is rescued by a beautiful unicorn and the end is magically and nicely tied up.  The music is beautiful as well.As a parent, I loved the lessons of forgiveness AND being able to say you are sorry.  Excessive pride can lead to ruin, as this movie shows.I plan on purchasing the book and reading it with my daughter.  I am sure she will enjoy it as much as she did the movie.",4,1

This book left me both satisfied and ambivilant; satisfied, because the ending of the series leaves the reader with the answers to most of the questions and storylines introduced... ambivilant, because the series that I've been reading now for over 20 years is over.

I had a problem getting it to come back on one time after cleaning the filters because I didn't have it put back together all the way properly. Be sure you click each piece back in to place all the way. I use it for carpets (the rotating carpet head with light & adjustable height is great) and then switch to the hard floor head/attachment to do my tile & wood floors. I like that the controls are on the handle where your hand is. It's been good to me so far. Grateful for the retractable cord, extending/telescoping wand. Wish it had a round brush attachment for dusting, though.",5,1

How dare you just waltz into a genre that you don't belong in and kill off one of the best characters?And what is with the Vong?  Did he even READ anything about the nature of the Force?  Life creates the Force.

Germans on the other hand, may want the world to know the greatness of thier heritage. Louise can say little and mean much. We are all better because she wrote about Joe who ate  one of those peanut butter and dill pickle sandwiches on an ordinary day that changed the world and we can read about it in her latest book.

This is a classic that everyone should have to read. It is a love story mixed in with action and no shortage of clever wording. Piers Anthony knows how to phrase things perfectly and get your mind moving - questioning what he will write next. I have written and published a book, but I can only dream to  write one this amazing. He personified death, along with the other incarnations, better than I could have hoped for. I had been taking the book day by day, reading a chunk a night, but when I got to 60% completion, I couldn't stop reading it! I thought I would be tired the next morning, but I jumped out of bed, proud that I had finished such a great book. It had been recommended by my step-dad who said it changed his life when he was my age.It is definitely a life-changing book and if you are reading this, do not take that sentence lightly.

3136929,Excellent,I highly recommend this book!!  The characters are developed in such a way the th tend to reflect a true life into themselves.

1822680,Enjoyable read,"This is another instance of the Kindle Daily Deal giving me the chance to discover an author I was not previously familiar with.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am now reading the 2nd book in the trilogy.  The Kindle Daily Deal doesn't often appeal to me, but when it does, I am usually pleased with the book.  The only problem is...in cases such as The Physician, where I get a great book at an excellent price, if I want to read the sequel or the next book in a series, the subsequent books are full price, which is too often the same price for the e-book as for a hard copy.  I will never understand why e-books cost as much as hard copies, given the significantly lower cost to produce.",5,1

The main character has a lot in common with the author, so I would suggest some counseling.  Seriously, homicide is the only way out of a fake engagement?  Unfortunately for her, she actually seems like a decent writer.  If the plot was toned down and not totally stupid, this author might be able to write a good book.",1,0
1916096,Language Lover,"I'm currently taking a Spanish class and have found this to be a very useful tool.  All the text is black and white  but it is very clearly printed and the words you're looking up are in bold print.  Love the size, fits well in my purse.  Also has a useful grammar section in the middle including a mini conjugation guide.  Also love the material that the cover is made of and actually purchased this particluar dictionary because it had a ""turtleback"" cover instead of paperback.  It's kind of like a plastic that you could easily wipe off if it gets dirty.  My only complaint is that when my instructor asked me to look up a word that should have given me ""shower head"" it said watering can, but everyother time I've looked up a word it has been accurate and 90% of the time it does have the word I'm looking for (my level is intermediate-three years in highschool and this is the second semester long college course I have taken, the first was 10 years ago.)",4,1

1067728,The Anti-Hemingway novel,"Sparse on dialogue and heavy on description, the novel paints an impressionistic picture of Italy and the world the protagonist lives in and comes to love. Written in the first person, it reads as a memoir. The pace is slow, however, making it tedious reading toward the middle. If you've seen the movie adaptation, The American, this is... slower. Nice read, but not a page turner.",4,1

821720,Wordsmithing at its finest,"Though this book came recommended, I worried that it might reek of the pseudo-spirituality of something like the Alchemist. Or that the story might be dull as that of something like the Historian. The beginning is indeed a little slow, which might put off some readers.But though this book received a lot of praise, it might not have received enough.  It's one of the very best of the decade; a story involving every emotion and told from a master wordsmith.  There aren't enough superlatives to describe this book; it's one of the few I've ever been genuinely sorry to finish.",5,1
4839613,Very Enjoyable read,I enjoyed reading this book. The female lead was strong and determined. I found myself laughing out loud in a few scenes. The male lead was just the right degree of mean.

852906,Execellent Crime/Mystery Thriller,"It saddened me to know that Larsson passed away several years ago and there are only three novels in this captivating series.  ""The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" captures the reader's attention almost immediately.  Blomkvist is an extremely relatable character while Salander is an engaging femme fatale in this dark Noir novel.  The reader can easily envision the cold and lonely islands of Sweden as Larsson does an excellent job creating the imagery necessary to tell such a complex yet gripping tale.  Overall, I'd highly recommend ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."" I've already started reading ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"" as I understand this is a worthy continuation of Blomkvist and Salander's story.",4,1

6575039,Great headset for the price,"Sound quality is good, build quality exceeded expectations. Take notice of the connection, though. It has two separate plugs, one for sound, one for the microphone. So this headset will require an adapter to use on a iPad, iPod or any computer with only one jack for sound/mic. The volume adjuster is nice and works well, microphone is sensitive enough. Overall, I would by this headset again.",5,1
124969,Entertaining for little ones,"This is a good, entertaining app for my 3 1/2 year old great grandson.  He loves picking colors and it also is a learning game for colors.  There are lots of pictures to choose from and it keeps him occupied for periods of time.",5,1

It was a wonderful read, it takes you into the world of BDSM with a Dom and a new Sub and it explores the Subs growing feeling for the world she did not understand and also her growing feeling for the young gorgeous gym owner.  I don't like to give too much of the story away but I would highly recommend it, it is sexy, steamy hot and leaves you wanting more and luckily for us this is the first in hopefully many more.",4,1

2221074,"Good read, but more like a  science textbook","Having been a science major, this book at times reminded me of reading a biology textbook. At other times though, the author does use his literary skills and story telling ability and keeping things humourous; especially when he tells of the murder, deception, treachery, intrigue and chemical warfare of his beloved ants.There is A LOT of theory in this book. He will typically describe an organisms behavior or behavioral trends and then desrcibe the competing hypothoses for these trends, phenomena or divergance from these typical trends.Like I said though, this book is technical. Don't attempt reading it unless you have completed 2 courses of undergrad biology and calculus, as well as chemisty (most of the chemicals used by ants and the like involve simple organic compounds I was a chem major myself.)In other words, this is not like On Human Nature or Journey to the Ants: This is more like a 3rd or 4th year advanced biology course textbook.",4,1
1152673,This book has it all!,"As a reader, this book satisfied me on many levels.  It has a touching romantic reunion, gut-twisting suspense, and wrenching emotional impact.  I especially liked the development of the &quot;villain&quot; because it was done so subtly that even I began to doubt my perception of him.  Ms. Stockenberg excels at novels that explore the mother/daughter relationship and this one is no exception.  If you like suspense, romance, and family relationships all wrapped up in a credible story, TIDEWATER should make you very happy.",5,1
2904322,Amazing,Fantastic novel of interconnected short stories about people trying to survive the apocalypse. Crisp prose and haunting emotion makes this book stand out among most other apocalyptic novels.,5,1

Their banter was hilarious and they seemed like old souls in a young body.I'm not going to delve into the story because I want you to discover the greatness of this book for yourself but,I will warn you. Be prepared to laugh out loud and shed many tears. You are in for a emotional roller coaster ride that you will enjoy immensely.",5,1

5653949,"It's so sad where they are now, buy this and get nostalgic","I'm very surprised the current-day version of this band isn't mainstream. They may as well be with how much they say their name and brag about being in their band...but that's not the case here. The speed of songs like Suicide's An Alternative and Memories Of Tomorrow, the upbeat raw energy of I Saw Your Mommy, the doomy raw energy of I Shot The Devil, all one masterpiece after another. Although probably all fans will disagree with me, I actually think Institutionalized is the worst song on the CD, and especially in its place, since listening to a minute long song does not put me in listening mode for a four minute song. The lyrics also sound pretty forced, but then again, they are not great. But the music keeps me coming back, and you have to own this.",4,1
6519040,Infinitely flexible; a tweaker's delight!,"I purchased the Harmony 520 based on all the favorable reviews I've read, and I must say I'm amazed by this product.  It can control up to 15 ""devices"" and can be programmed for several different ""activities"", such as Watch a Movie, Listen to CD's, etc.  The Harmony website makes configuring your remote a breeze....once you learn to navigate through all the menus, and this does take a little practice.  But once you get the hang of it, there's no end to what you can teach your remote to do for you.  I've never encountered a universal remote that was so flexible and full of options...you can make your commands as straightforward or as complex as you like; the choice is up to you.One slight quibble I have is with the size of the buttons on this particular model.  They are somewhat small (the entire remote is streamlined and sleek), so if you have a big thumb you might run into trouble operating it.  But otherwise it's a great product; I would recommend it to anyone.",4,1
3283170,Awesome Book!,I just want to say that I wanted to see Tina get the crap beat out of her and I don't like abuse. I couldn't stay in the same run for a minute.I did feel sorry for Rever when I seen her had bonded with Tina and then later found his true mate Brenda. I seen the fireworks from the first day they saw each other.Just as with all of these books with this author they just keep sucking me deeper and deeper in. It's like being in a web and not being able to escape. You know the spider is coming but you know that the web won't let you go.The sex and suspense is what draws me in and she is so good with her words and characters. Thank you so much for writing all of these books.,5,1
2005467,Could not put it down...,"I will admit I like hiking and have lived in proximity the northern portions of the AT my whole life.  Having seen periodic articles in our local papers over the years I have had a casual interest in what hiking the AT must be like.  That being said I don't think an interest in hiking is even required to enjoy this well written and engaging book.You'll be drawn in on with the first couple pages as he contemplates the journey and ponders what lies ahead.  As David walks into the woods I felt his pains and concerns and was drawn into the trails quirks and traditions.  I admit I started reading thinking ""heck I'll read a chapter a nite it's a great wind-down book"". WRONG...I was sucked in...three hours and 120 pages later I had to skip to the epilogue so I could satisfy my immediate curiosities and get some sleep...needless to say its and awesome read that I highly recommend.",5,1

Be resigned to a parental arranged match? Oh, Please!The delightful start to this new series deals with this shifter's dilemna, and answers it, ""With magic, of course!"" There is an alternate plane, not too large of course, accessible only by those shapeshifters who are serious about finding a compatible match. Those talented in magic who can access the Crossroads are the gatekeepers.Ezzy feels like her back is against the wall to make a decision to mate, when her friend Kris scandalously suggests using the Crossroads to scope out a potential mate. And, trust me, different shifter types can and do attract to one another. But, the Crossroads is not without its hazards.Damn, I wish I could find my way there!",4,1

Now they are forced to deal with the craziness of Los Angeles, Jack's fame, paparazzi, and a cruel evil publicist. I think all the things they had to go through made them so much stronger in the end. I absolutely loved how great of a father Jack was to Tristan. I think that made him that much sexier. When they decided to stop keeping secrets, running away from each other, and not letting the fans tear them apart they finally were able to live their lives. Such a great great story. So highly recommended!",5,1
5723552,One of the Best Albums of the '90s,"""Unplugged"" is Eric Clapton's latter-day masterpiece.  It's intimate and moving with a rich, organic sound.  And, rather than simply rip through his biggest hits on acoustic guitar, E.C. had the good sense to throw in some lesser-known material and experiment with re-interpreting his past work.  ""Signe"" is a beautiful instrumental, ""Alberta"" is a swinging blues that's perfectly suited to the stripped-down treatment, and his jazzy reworking of ""Layla"" stands up well against the landmark original.  This album should always be considered one of Clapton's best.",5,1

8115259,A Don't Miss Read!!,Henry Simpson writes in a way that brings his subjects alive and real when you are reading . You can get so involved in the story that you can't put down the book.

4182712,Absolutely worth buying,"Since I get most of my books from the library, it is a rare treat to find one that makes me want to purchase it (right away!) to add to my home library. This is a very gentle, thoughtful book with practical, accessible suggestions for family activities that are well suited to young children (and their slightly frazzled mothers). The consolidation of fun, reasonable, low-key activities and ideas for kids make this a book that I enjoyed reading and look forward to purchasing for our family.",5,1

906066,Powerful,"I almost gave up on this book. The first half was somwhat tedious to me because it focused on - more or less - the ""mechanics"" of being...I felt connection with the spiritual was missing here. But, I stuck with it, and realized the author was laying the foundation for the second half of the book which was about onness, spirituality, and God....The second half of the book was trully awe-inspiring and enlightening. It outlined a truly crediable explination - much based on St. Thomas' teachings - of the nature of spirit, being, good, evil, etc.The only detraction from this book is that it is extreemly detailed and more accessable to a ""student"" of theology rather than the average person (even more so that St. Thomas' works in my view)...But a great book never the less - a real ""keeper""-Joe M.",4,1
3676566,Beautifully Charming,"Author Cinta Garcia has written one of the most charming, exciting books you will find. Her ability to create characters is incredible. You will love Little Nani, you will laugh with the caffeine addicted zombie, you may even cry for the double-faced boy. But, you will find funny, sweet adventures in all of them with wonderful lessons such as environmentalism and being kind to one another. The illustrations by Almudena Romero are breathtaking as well. This is a triumph of writing you will forever regret missing. You might compare it the Wizard of Oz, but it more than stands apart in its originality.Just don't get hit by the flying muffins.",5,1
3377511,Fascinating,An intriguing read. Written very factually with no apparent axe to grind other than what to do with this series of events. Not well written but that does not take away from the rather incredible tale he has to tell. Really got me thinking.

The author forgoes the typical military, hi-tech storyline and instead focuses on developing immensely intriguing characters ( alien and human).

Well worth the read and highly entertaining for any military sci fi junky.",5,1

7909422,"AmazonBasics Wood Suit Hangers - Set of 16 is a nice set of well-finished hangers for your good blouses, shirts, and dresses.","I long ago evicted the dreadful old wire hangers and substituted plastic hangers for them. That was a step forward but I still wanted to have a better quality hanger for my more delicate blouses and dresses. Same thing for shirts and suits. These wooden hangers seemed to fit the bill. They are made of a good quality wood, smoothly sanded, with a lacquered finish and they have a ridged bar that holds folded items.They are of medium size, not as big as the hangers that come with men's suits but they are plenty big enough for my purposes. The metal hanging hook swivels and there are two notches for holding dresses and such in place. I am pleased with them and plan on getting another box of them. They are very well priced.As an additional note, these hangers also are available in a larger pack of 30 hangers at a favorable price. You may not need that many hangers but if you do, it's certainly something to consider.",4,1

The descriptions of the time period was interesting and the great character development allowed you a front row seat into a despicable time in our history.I am not giving it 5 stars because I felt the writing during the Carrier's time in prison did not carry the full impact and weight of the situation and the writing became redundant. Also, I would have been interested in hearing how the accusation of witchcraft would have followed Sarah in her life as an adult. Maybe a good sequel?I look forward to reading more books from Kathleen Kent.",4,1

He breaks you out of your rigid preconceptions and shows some outside-the-box sales ideas, something I can appreciate, and it's definitely helped me in my line of business (music marketing). His experience pays off for the reader. Highly recommended as one of the best sales-related books I've come across.",5,1

I was wondering how much more Dahlia could take.  Her life has been filed with tragedy and when she finds true love, again, deception has her thinking, is love enough?  The story is rich, the dialogue excellent. Loved how the author mixed music into the story.  I am very thankful that she did not write these books as &#34;novellas&#34; but chose to put out full tomes.  It reminds me of the story of Christian and Anastasia but without the kink.  Dahlia and River are in love and committed but both have &#34;issues&#34; and secrets that throw road blocks into their being together.  I loved it and would get other books from this author.",5,1

4614869,Looking forward to reading this!,I've already read the first 3 Sorcerer's Ring books and found the story line & characters to be engaging and very interesting.

I was so happy to come across this series.,4,1

Even better you get a finished story and a happy ending.",4,1
7779961,Works Well On Pergo Floors,"TheHoover FloorMate SpinScrub Wet/Dry Vacuum, FH40010Bwas extremely easy to assemble and use.  The upper handle folds downward, so it doesn't take up that much space when stored.This worked well on Pergo laminated floors - ones that have a lot of dog traffic.  The scrubbers cleaned the floor thoroughly and the wet vac did a good job of getting the dirty liquid up off the floor quickly so that it didn't dry and leave a film.  The fact that we weren't reusing the dirty water to wash new sections of the floor is a very nice feature.  The FloorMate didn't seem too heavy or awkward to use, and the controls were nicely designed.It sure beats using a mop and pail, and is much faster too.",4,1

1060480,A Book that actually interested me in Politics,"Wow. I live at a small Army base in Italy, and our book store is some what limited. I saw this book up on the shelves (right next to the O'Reilly Factor) and decided to give it a shot. Within the first three chapters I realized that I must be a Libertarian. All of the points that Mr. Elder makes are clear, concise and well backed with fact. More importantly, for the first time, I heard someone else intelligently discuss issues from the same view point that I discuss them. It's a shame the media only shows Democrat-Republican politics, because this movement is going to grow with a lot of voters, like myself, who are displeased with big government, media hysteria and the self-aggrandizing B.S. of Washington. Heck, I work for the Government and I'll tell you, bigger is definately not better. Open your mind and Mr. Elders book, and you'll feel, like I did, that some one is on the right track, that maybe we'll get the government we deserve.",5,1

1227580,prophetic,"Or, maybe not prophetic, just common sense. Foreword by Sen. Warren Rudman.  This is an analysis of the debt situation in 1992, with plenty of charts.  Blame is laid on both Democrats and Republicans, though it would seem that Clinton did heed these warnings when he became President. Interesting reading for a better understanding of the fact that our ""current"" economic problems are actually over a decade old.",5,1

5731378,Deja Vu All Over Again....,".... as Yogi Berra might have said. It's hard to believe that Tangerine Dream could compose music so absolutely ""spot on"" for the film Sorcerer without having seen the movie but, as pointed out by other reviewers that is exactly what happened. I recommend you see the movie FIRST.  Then, consider buying this CD which is at once captivating but definitely creepy!  Filmed on location in the heart of a Dominican Republic rain forest, Sorcerer is NOT for the faint of heart.  Although the film and the music are both thirty years old, both compare favorably with the music and plot of any contemporary soundtrack or movie plot. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED by a listener who is NOT fond of Tangerine Dream!",5,1
4846094,Distress Through Biology,"This novel takes a candid look at the woman's thought process and the emotional swings associated with suffering through menstruation, while dealing with adversity (such as an antagonistic boss). It also examines the affliction women face in both cultural and spiritual contexts, referring to the fable (or biblical fact, depending on your viewpoint) that women are punished for their misdeed in the Garden of Eden. The plight of dealing with the opposite sex, who is free of suffering, has a profound effect on the protagonist's view. Eve says of men: ""They're all capable of being Hitlers in my view--each and every one of them!"" With thoughts like these rolling around in her head, the reader is inclined to wonder what exactly she might she be capable of doing, and if she will act out on her lethal fantasies. Vividly written, McDowell writes a deft page turner that is heavy on internal characterization and keeps the reader intrigued.",5,1
5172093,Mustang Sally,"After Eli and Alanso made a debacle of things, Sally runs to the Powertools crew for some time away and space to sort out what she really wants, but just as it is all coming together a secret from her past threatens to ruin it all. This was a great finish to Eli and Alanso's story, given that Sally is the elusive finishing third piece to their relationship. You get to know the other five guys (Kaige, Holden, Carver, Roman and Bryce) a bit more in this one too, and I thought that was great, since I didn't feel we got to see much of them in the first book in this series. I look forward to reading the next book in this series, Super Nova, about Kaige, due out December 2013!",5,1

7562499,Electric Wok,I had this wok now for a month and wanted to wait before reviewing to really test it out.  I use it on a daily basis.  It is excellent.  I had no idea how evenly it cooks I know now to do my rice ahead of anything.  Then I stir fry because it takes only 5 min to get the perfect vegetables and chicken.  The shrimp takes a lot less.  Im stil working on sauces.  I use only peanut or sesame oil in it and use only a plastic spatula.  I have no problems with the finish It cleans easily and the base can be easily removed.  I would recommend it.,5,1

I can just leave it in the usb otg and it doesn't even look like there is anything plugged in.Another thing I like about it is there is a led on the back so you can tell that it is being used.My reason for not giving it 5 stars is the ring on the back is not normal sized, I could not fit my keychain through it so I wouldn't lose it. So what I have to do is get some fishing wire or a very small ring to put though there to then fit to the keychain. But other then this 0 problems at all.",4,1

3170774,The American Way,"Steve Darnell and Alex Ross's ""Uncle Sam"" is a devastating read. There's no easy way to summarize the book-- it's most easily described as an all-American fever dream. We follow the titular character as he stumbles through a crime-ridden nation, homeless and decrepit. He is bombarded by memories of the crimes his so-called great nation has committed.There are no two ways about it-- ""Uncle Sam"" is a polarizing read. Its take on American history is unflinching, and the book is quick to contrast the ideals of the United States with its actions. At times Darnell's script seems a little too on-the-nose and simplistic, but his frustration is palpable and gives the book much of its energy. Ross's confident, expressive and very human artwork makes this book a must-read for just about any comics fan.",4,1

2534240,Very Difficult to Get Through,"The back cover of this book makes the hero, an ex-special forces agent named Avakian as one of the most interesting characters since Jason Bourne.  I was greatly disappointed as I found him super boring to say the least.  The book takes place in South Africa and some of the Dutch names are confusing.  The author's writing style is not effective at all (some of the flashbacks are difficult to follow) and I yawned during what should have been tense moments.  Skip this one.",1,0
2055191,READ THIS BOOK!,"I happened to think this was one of the best Seventh Doctor novels that have come out since &quot;The Hollow Men&quot;. Something is affecting the Seventh Doctor, something familiar, and he decides to face it alone and  leave Ace with his old friends Ian and Barbara. But when he arrives in 1963  he comes to realize that everything has changed and neither of his former  travelling companions know anything about ever travelling with a Doctor.  And when The Doctor and Ace reach the source of the problem in Victorian  England it becomes clear to Ace that the Doctor has apparently become evil  and she must flee from him before he kills her. I feel that the Doctor Who  novels work the best when you could picture them as an actual episode.  That's when I start feeling sad. But this book is a must have for fans of  Sylvester McCoy's Doctor and fans of the series. Robert Perry and Mike  Tucker, PLEASE WRITE MORE!",5,1

Don't assess like you're sitting in Starbucks,  leaning back on lice ridden plush furniture,  drinking a $7 cup of coffee,  while really only holding it to look cool,  tucking your legs under your fat stomach, while watching everyone around you thinking that they are thinking how cool you are.....",4,1

949004,Great Writing & Great Story,"In an ocean of glittering loving agnst filled teenage vampires it was refreshing to read a classic vampire tale. The story is a good one although the specific reason for the main character being a lesbian is still unclear to me...I am not critiquing the fact that she was, I just didn't feel I understood the particular choice. Since the other reviews here will no doubt focus on the likes and dislikes of the story, I want to point out what I found most enjoyable. David Wellington is a great writer. I am not referring to his story line, but rather the way in which he puts the words together. Vampires, Werewolves, Zombies - makes no difference - it is just evident that he writes well and that is not something often found in my favorite genre, Horror.",5,1

I highly recommend this book!",5,1
7360428,Beating Expectations,"I have been very very pleased with this case, although I wish there was a 4.5 star ratings. Truth to tell, the only quibble I have about this case is that the viewing angle pictured is about the only angle you can get before the magnets let go. But for me, this has been trivial. Otherwise, I have been extremely satisfied with this cover. Light, but provides good coverage for the screen and for the rest of the tablet. It took me a while to become adept at removing the stylus, but it poses no problem now. However, this case provided adequate protection to the table after a 3' fall from a desk to a hardwood floor: nary a scratch nor a hiccup. &#34;It took a lickin' and kept on tickin'&#34;. as they used to stay.I'm very happy with this case so far, and as of now I see no reason to change my opinion.",5,1
2489789,Great Teen Book,"I too have read this book and found it a very good YA read.  I enjoyed how the plot's theme evolved and kept you wondering.It would recommend it readers that like dark fantasy and mystery.  I think if you enjoy authors like Garth Nix, Cassondra Clare, Neil Gaiman, Steven King, EA Poe and Brom or books like Plucker, City of Bones, Riddle of Epsilon, Neverwhere, Graveyard Book than this is right up your alley.  I would also place it in with books like Speak if you are looking for ""teen issues"" themed books.I can't wait for the sequel ""Mr. Monster""  which I will have to get from Amazon UK.",5,1
4547757,Like it - mostly!,"I really like the recipes in this book. I'm always looking for healthy slow cooker books, and this is a pretty good one. I like that the recipes have nutritional information, and that they use fresh, readily available ingredients. On the whole, they're mainstream, family-friendly recipes. I really like the Vegetable Soup, and the Hamburger Pie (with homemade mashed potato topping, yum!) is in my slow cooker as I write this review.The only thing I don't like, and the reason I only gave it 4 stars, are the ridiculous portion sizes. Most recipes have a portion size of 1/2 cup and make 12-14 servings. Come on! It's not a problem doubling the portion sizes, which then makes them normal, but it's the principal of the thing. The recipes are healthy. The authors didn't need to make the portion sizes abnormallly small to make them look healthier.",4,1
1618980,Loved it!!,I loved it!!  There were unexpected twists and turns that kept me guessing. The characters are believable and complex. I kept having to make a mental map in my head about how the characters were connected. I enjoy reading a book where I make guesses about what will happen next--and be completely wrong. This was one of those books. A mystery without blood and gore. Fantastic!!,5,1
5957669,I'VE BEEN THUNDERSTUCKED!!!!!,"This is an AWESOME cd. AC/DC really knows how to please their fans and this LIVE cd is no exception. The song collection was great and they were very good choices. Brian Johnson did a great job with the vocals and Angus was just pheonomenal as always on lead guitar. If your an AC/DC fan then you're nuts if you don't already have this cd, and thats the truth. Other rock fans should get this as well. OUT OF THIS WORLD!I highly recommend on getting this cd.",5,1

532394,This book should make us all pause,"This is a great, necessary AND daunting book.  Not daunting in how it is written-- Gazzaniga is a clear writer-- but it what it suggests, namely that as right as you think you are is as wrong as you can turn out to be.  As much as we humans like to think we aren't governed by reflex, but by reflection this books demonstrates that the circuitry in our brains can be ""hard-wired"" in such a way as to set up reflexes in our mind and make true objectivity very difficult.  Maybe the lesson to take from it is to assume that we all shoot from the hip much of the time and need to pause more and gather as much facts and data as we can before we come to a conclusion.  Very thought provoking. I would recommend this book highly.",5,1

3202741,Review from Books That Heal Kids,I am an elementary school counselor and I teach lessons around the message that it's okay to make a mistake and we all make them. Most importantly - how to recover from a mistake! Kids are working hard everyday practicing and acquiring new skills in so many areas. Part of growing up is learning how to deal with making a mistake. This is a brand new book to my shelf so I haven't gotten a chance to use it yet. It's going to be a HIT. No doubt about it because of the empowering message. Kids need to hear it's absolutely OKAY to flub up because as we say in our school: Mistakes are opportunities for learning. Mistake DOES NOT mean failure or there is something wrong with you. Sometimes children get that stuck in their heads. You're going to appreciate this new one. It's well written with great illustrations.,5,1
1384878,Miller Delivers Once Again!,"I am a big Linda Lael Miller fan and was ecstatic to get to read this! I am also a lover of romance AND westerns, so this made my day!

1712042,Don't let the cover put you off,"I've looked at this book before and didn't buy it b/c of the horrible cover.  This is an outstanding book!  This book is better than three of the four Malcolm Gladwell books I've read.  This is the first book I have ever read then liked so much and felt it was important enough that I immediately started reading it again to really burn it in.  It touches on personal habits, business habits, so on and so on, it really covers everything, it is far more in-depth than I expected.  The best book I have read in years!",5,1
8493247,This series is so crazy and amazing at the same time,"OMG What craziness. This series is so crazy and amazing at the same time. One of my fears comes true and someone has been following Juliette every time she meets Elliott. Spending most of her life with these people, being the president's mistress and sons of the president disappearing she should have known &#34;eyes&#34; would be on her. She is just lucky it was not someone ruthless.With two brothers down, suspicion arising and what looks like only one book to go I was curious what this book would entail. We gain more insight into the gang, the past of Elliott and Juliette as well as Jase. We get history, thoughts of the present and desires of the future. The author is slowly pulling everything together and you are left with a semi-cliffhanger as you will wonder who and how it will conclude. The craziness of it all is exciting and I am counting the days until the next book in the series releases.",5,1

2014969,A Brief History of Physics,"I just discovered this book in my school library yesterday.  It is quite fortunate that I did!  Reading the original A Brief History of Time left me with a few questions, and this illustrated version answered nearly all of them.  It is very easy to read and understand (thanks to Hawking's lighter tone of writing).  As he states in the preface, simply reviewing the illustrations and captions you can get the main idea of the Future Light Cone, the Singularity theorem, general relativity, abolition of absolute time, travelling through space-time with the aid of wormholes, and much more.  Not only do you get a quick lesson on cosmology and space-time, but you also learn of the famous physicists throughout time.  This book may also serve as a great vocabulary builder.  It is my opinion that A Brief History of Time should be a required read in high school science classes.",5,1

Finished the book in 2 tries.This shows the character of Joe and then turns and twists of how his mind works.  The character of Butch is revealed  as good in character, but the ending threw me.

He could say more with a raised eyebrow or a cold stare than many actors can with pages of dialogue.  And he could be funny too!Begining with the first episode, it is interesting to see the character of Cheyenne develop and learn more about him.  I can hardly wait for future seasons to be released.Good stuff!!!",5,1

4217496,A truly amazing Truth,In the writing of this record of an incredible woman. A true patriot and a Biblical woman of faith and wisdom. I found the life of Sojourner Truth to be both challenging and inspiring. Early in her life she began constructing her views and putting her beliefs into practice. She found strength to forgive her owners without ever excusing what was done to herself or others. A truly impressive accomplishment. The author managed to give evidence of extensive research without being in the least tedious. He presented the life of a multifaceted person while including the things that revealed her limitations and humanity. It is one of the best written biographies that I have read. I highly recommend it to anyone. It blessed me.,5,1

4938745,"Great ending, worth reading them all to get here","The writers skills continued to improve through the progression of the 5 levels/stories.  By book 5 it is hard to believe the work is being given away for free.  Definitely on my look for and pay for more list.  While I strongly recommend reading them all in order, if your feeling cheap or in a hurry, you could probably get by with reading book 1 and 5. But again, read them all, it's worth it.  In the 5 books there was only one place that I noticed an author cheat to extend the plot, it was in the last 3rd of book 5 (horn delay).  My perception of the character and the situation made the delay seem unlikely, but distantly possible.  In the end, I thought the author made a good choice.The key to these books is the realism, the characters are real people, solving real problems, with real people skills and problems.",5,1
4181860,"The Slog of Slogs, Boys!","I liked this book.  It was grim.  It was violent.  It was peppered with gnostic imagery and philosophical meandering.  Those are things I enjoy, and things I expect from Bakker.What I've also grown to expect is slow progression.  I really could have used more plot and less grueling descriptions of battles in which people we care nothing about are slaughtered wholesale.  When the plot pops, it pops, but too often Bakker buries it under layers of fantastical war fiction.  Similar in spirit to the second entry in his previous trilogy, but less focused.",4,1

When I draw / doodle in prayer, I discover that while my hands, and eyes are occupied,  my spirit thoughts are free to yield to Him.  Sybil MacBeth confronts all those excuses, fears, and objections we have to drawing, then, - with grace and without  judgement - she lovingly encourages and gives you permission to step into this unfamiliar path anyway.  The book itself is colorful and delightfully planned.  Plus, I had a blast shopping for a new set of pencils and markers.",5,1

8964234,Bruce Almighty,"Bruce Nolan is a local Eyewitness News TV reporter in Buffalo, New York, best known for doing human interest stories--which makes everyone happy but him. Bruce would much rather be replacing the soon-to-retire anchorman. Essentially, Bruce is disconnected with everything in his life and rarely misses an opportunity to complain about it. This movie is rambunctiously funny. Jim Carrey is the man. I can't help but recommend it.",5,1
2907395,A passionate plea for community,"When our true selves and the lives we are actually living are at odds, it takes a toll on our being. Yet, it often requires a personal crisis to recognize that we are out of synch with our values and beliefs. ""Disregarded"" is a morality tale about the importance of authenticity in our work lives and our personal lives. Mr. Bender speaks eloquently for all of us yearning to exercise our unique gifts. This should be required reading for anyone toiling in the educational system today. His story is rich with insight gleaned from an extensive bibliography and Bender has extracted the kernel of truth from a variety of philosophies, including leadership theory, social science, spirituality and literature. An engaging reevaluation of what it means to be disregarded and how we can rise above situations to reclaim our dignity and forge a work of value.",5,1

The new technology in the LED screen makes editing photos much easier as the view angle is no longer critical as on my older iMac. But enough about the computer. When I went to load my Adobe Creative Suite (a collection of 6 or 8 discs) I found this iMac does NOT have a CD/DVD built in drive, as does my older one. Well, I called Apple and their solution was their super duper, very expensive latest model disk drive that I could have rushed delivered for free. All I had to do is pay the big buck and wait for 2 weeks. OUCH!I wanted faster a free deliver with a more reasonable price. That's where my ol' buddy Amazon came thru for me. This one was very inexpensive and with Prime, I had it in 24 hours for only a couple extra bucks for overnite shipping.

If this is a hint of what is coming in the autostereoscopic department, then maybe there really is hope for glasses free 3-D TVs someday.

9020916,What was cut...?,"I was kind of surprised by this film in the sense that this doesn't fit into Hollywood's formula for making horror movies these days. Meaning that the system thinks that most horror fans have double digit IQ's. Then I found out that it was independently made, and it all made sense. It actually has a carefully orchestrated plot. It even builds up on a mental level and not just on a visual one. Of course, they're really are a lot of brain-dead horror fans out there who couldn't understand something as clever as this if the jigsaw killer made their life depend upon it. As far as the uncut version goes, I wouldn't waste your money on it unless you don't have a copy of it already in your collection. I don't know what insignificant detail that the MPAA made them cut out of this movie, because I didn't see it at all.

Which one you get should be based on the number of adults &amp; kids in your viewing party. If there are more adults, rent it or get it, if you have more kids, go to the theater. Its not really that bad.But why? Simply because this, the original, has more profound humor that kids won't get.

I'll be off to explore more of this group, but for now here's my take on Quicksilver:It's a treat to stumble across a thrilling story, well-told. But it's much better to find one that also manages to teach a little something along the way.Toni Dwiggins has written a terrific story that will make your brain that much better for having read it. The beauty of Quicksilver is that it informs effortlessly. A completely painless injection of knowledge, if you will. Bill Bryson and Jon Krakauer do this best, but Toni Dwiggins seems to have taken notes.This story illuminates an aspect of the California Gold Rush that I had no idea existed. And now, I'm fascinated to learn more.Fantastic.",5,1

Pulls ups are the foundation of the fighting man and a fit man. If you can't do puil-ups, there is no shame in that. However, the same is not in seeking improvement. It takes time, and even in the world of the quick solution, even this one tells you to get their in 7 weeks, you need to put in work.I have used it, and I remember when I used to struggle to do six, now I can do twelve straight and still knock out more.

633828,Starts out a bit confusing but ends up good,"The reason I say the beginning was confusing is because I had to learn the language of the time period the book was set in--the future.  After reading &#34;For Darkness Shows the Stars&#34; I thought I'd be somewhat familiar with terms used, but this story takes place in a separate development, therefore the characters came up with some of their own terms in connection with the victims of the past tragedy and the explanation of the shared history of both peoples.  After a few chapters wherein I learned a bunch of terms that applied to new inventions, the book became easier to read.  I would suggest sticking with it until you become a bit more comfortable with terms like palmports, genetemps, flutternotes, regs, reduced, etc.It's a good sci-fi dystopian story but along the lines of &#34;The Scarlet Pimpernel.&#34;",4,1

I'm assuming this was the author's first attempt at writing. Poor character development, trite plot, lame action. It feels like someone wanted to write a sunday school story but tried make it interesting to draw in preteen kids so threw in some ""medieval-like"" action and setting. Every other page is some repetitive speech on God's love. Or someone says ""help me Jesus"" and is immediately cured of some sort of opium addiction with no withdrawals or work on their part. A woman in a crowd throwing things at a suspected criminal overhears him mumble something about God or Jesus and immediately stops the abuse because she now wonders ""Is he a murderer....or a Christian man?""

My old headunit allowed me to use the remote to do everything. I live in ATL so there's all kinds of idiots you have to look out for. Other then that it's great.,5,1

He keeps up a series of disguises and meets with FBI agents and reporters and gangsters. There are some great characters in the book. My favorite was a Bosnian gangster named Little Boy. It's all a little over the top, but not completely unbelievable. There were times when I wasn't sure which way the story was going to go.Chris Knopf writes a tight thriller that kept me turning pages and wondering what was going to happen next. I've always like a good heist or con man story, and while this isn't either, it had the same feeling of a protagonist that manages to stay one step ahead of the game. It was a lot of fun to read.",4,1

Her vocals are strong and brilliantly crisp without sounding produced. Speaking of the band, I love some of the new variations of the songs, namely Possession. Beautiful. The editing of the concert is a bit jarring sometimes. You can't seem to focus on any one image for more than a second or two. But that is a small gripe as the music speaks for itself. Also, the extras are extremely satisfying, all the music videos from Afterglow and a 10 minute featurette with Sarah and Rex.",5,1

Many years ago, I compared Starker's performance to the Rostropovich performance and I preferred Mr. Starker's hands down.  His technique and the brilliance of his Strad.  By comparison, the cello that Rostropovich performed on sounded gutsy and constipated in my own opinion.  But I digress....  Mr. Starker is an inspiration.  I have his performance of the Bach Suites - the recordings between 1963 and 65.  Thank you Mr. Starker.",5,1

6161339,No Wonderland,"This is a well-produced, pristine recording of one of the worst new scores for a Broadway show in memory.  The cast is full of top-notch actor/singers, and one cringes at the thought that this is the type of material they've trained for all these years.  Not only is the music derivative and boring, but it covers so many styles and genres that there is no cohesion or through-line to the theme of the show (if there is one).  Add to that the clunky, obvious lyrics that lay like obstructions over the music and you have a score that never should have seen the light of a recording studio.  Frank Wildhorn has produced one floppo musical after another in the past decade and ""Wonderland"" continues the tradition.  Just skip on down the yellow brick road.",1,0

It's highly unusual for me to DNF a book but this one stretched my credulity to the breaking point. The writing was ... not polished, and it needed a really strong edit to weed out the insanely repetitive phrasing and to create something other than cardboard characters and situations. I hopscotched to various points in later chapters hoping that the author had found some rhythm but unfortunately not. Other readers might not mind the roughness and the derivative treatment.

I found Roxann and Joe completely likeable and respectable.  Unfortunately, there is such a little part in this book for Joe and she is so good at blocking the few advances he makes that when she and Joe fall in love, you find yourself asking, ""Where was I?""  But buy the book, anyway.  Stephanie Bond moves the story forward at a good clip and with firm control, keeping you reading and wondering and feeling fairly satisfied that all the pieces of her complex puzzle fit so nicely together.  All but the romance.",4,1

I'm giving this 4 stars although I likely think it would end up just under that rating if they allowed partial stars. Overall the stories were an okay mix. ""The Last Nephew"" was a real standout story for me. Reading this issue was enough to convince me that I need to keep reading subsequent issues, so I've added all of them to my TBR list.

5267654,Sweet Sensual Rapunzel,"Wow! I saw an email earlier today about this ebook and I immediately downloaded it and read it tonight. I mean, I just finished it. I adored her book PASSION and especially loved PATIENCE. Her stories are about living life to the fullest. Although her books are sensual, they are also centered around FAMILY, FOOD, FRIENDS, FAITH and FIDELITY also. This book was novella length, and did NOT disappoint. I really fell in love with the honesty of the characters and the classic Rapunzel story retold. I've been looking forward to her next book PRIMROSE and I don't care WHEN she finishes it, I like Matthew (from PATIENCE) will wait for her to finish PRIMROSE in her own good time.

Having just returned from London I found the tales and yarns behind the writing and distribution of the English Bible not only factually true but exciting to read.All early translators from Jerome to Wycliffe to Tyndale and Luther found those in control of the masses resistant to free speech, open books and the truth of scripture. Just a few anecdotes about the ways the monarchs of government and church treated their slaves/serfs shows us why they hated scripture for it led inexoribly to free thinking and free living. In the same ways that slave owners in America, Nazis, Communists and South African leaders hated scripture the brutal popes and kings burned those at the stake who dared publish it for all to read.This book can inspire us all to speak boldly about freedom of speech and freedom of thought.",5,1

6003902,Chill Is A Thrill,"Jimmy Buffett started out as a country singer-songwriter.  His first several releases were strong country-rock records.

For Licensed To Chill, Mr. Buffett again duets with Mr. Jackson as well as several other notable country stars like Kenny Chesney, George Strait, Toby Keith and Martina McBride.  The results are a pleasant mixing of country and parrothead rock.  The album's best track is his lone duet with a non-country performer, Bill Withers, &quot;Playin' The Loser Again&quot; which finds Mr. Buffett holding his own with the powerful Mr. withers and sounding quite soulful.  Licensed To Chill is yet another solid album that will keep Parrotheads happy until Mr. Buffett's next release.",4,1

8242553,So Sweet...,"The Best Week of My Life is a fun, quick-read novel. Daphne Merrill is on vacation & fell in front of her crush, Carter Pruitt. Daphne feels so embarrassed and feels like this is the worst day of her life. Once she finds out Carter is going to be on vacation with her and in the same hotel, she realizes that her vacation may turn out to be better what she expected. Maybe even the best week of her life.I LOVE this novel. It's so cute. Carter is sweet & sensitive. His situation is sooo sad and is the main reason why he's scared to fall in love. I liked that Suzanne D. Williams (once again) mentioned how important it is to wait until you're married to have sex (no the book isn't religious). This is a perfect novel to read on a day at the beach (since the book took place at the beach). EXCELLENT Suzanne D. Williams!",5,1

2526217,Loved It!,"This review pertains to The Chance by Robyn Carr.  Thanks to Netgalley and Harlequin for the opportunity to read and review.  I am a huge fan of Robyn Carr and her books are always at the top of my reading list.  The Chance is book 4 is the Thunder Point series but easily reads as a standalone novel.  I absolutely loved this book and it is classic Robyn Carr writing.  Great Characters, we originally met Laine in a previous book.  A great setting, back in the seaside town of Thunder Point.  Her writing about Thunder Point almost makes the town a secondary character.  It sounds like a wonderful place!!  I love the secondary romances often featured in Robyn Carr's books.  It is these stories which make putting her books down impossible!  Don't make the mistake I made last night....I started this book at 8pm and was up to 3am reading!  Highly recommended to romance readers and fans of Robyn Carr.  You will not be disappointed in this book!",4,1
4278128,No stars,"Once more, I have failed to find a well-written horse novel. ""The A Circuit"" is a shallow, plastic trash wallow a la Jilly Cooper, without the gratuitous specifics. The unsympathetic stereotypical characters have no redeeming value. The only positive thing I can come up with is that there are no grammar or spelling errors. A good book leaves me feeling refreshed. This one left me wanting a shower.",1,0

I thought that it started off really, really slow but it finished with a good intensity. I am looking forward to the next book. I think that the chemistry between Chase and Em is really good. I hope that they continue that! I read this book over a weekend camping trip. It was a light and easy read!",4,1
2773455,A Vital Book- With Profound Revelations,"If you are familiar with 9-11, you might begin reading the book at the critical chapters which reveal Cheney's role in the planning and ""success"" of the 9-11 attacks.  With abundant footnotes, this book allows any of us to print documents, hammer on the halls of power, and the media, and demand the impeachment of a regime that has engineered a huge crime against Americans, humanity, in their bid for global dominance.Ruppert makes a compelling case which cannot be ignored, and deserves to be plastered across the world's headlines.  Our greatest hope for our country and the world is to rein in this regime (and, yes- it must be said- this crosses party lines- this is a bipartisan crime revealing the darkest side of the Shadow Government) which uses war and terror to silence dissent and control an increasingly aware public.The book is a powerful tool for all who seek truth, peace, justice, hope, in challenging the corrupt forces that dominate the world's most powerful institutions whose reign is about to end.",5,1
819432,Don't Miss This Book!,"This is one of the best five or so children's books in the world.  Most of the other reviewers have explained it accurately, although a few people apparently don't grasp the point of the book (and so ironically need it the most).  Why are there so few books out there showing that fantasy doesn't beat reality when reality is built of strong bonds of love?  This book does a great job of suggesting that point.",5,1
4983143,misunderstood,"I'm not sure why I bought this book, I didn't understand what it was.  I thought it was short stories, but it was all about sports oddities.  Too many statistics and facts.  You might enjoy it if you like sports.",1,0

5955968,Celine is back!!!! Again!,"Celine's new album is addictive and fun, its also much more cohesive than many of her previous releases.  It has an up to date dirty pop sound that should please her die hard fans and those new to her.  The songs range from catchy dance floor numbers to sultry torch songs. Its a keeper all the way through, except for the inexplicable inclusion of ""Have You Ever Been in Love"" a song from her last album released just one year ago. ""Sorry for Love"" is from the last album too, but at least its a newly produced version. ""Have You Ever Been in Love"" is a good song, but doesn't belong on this album; not only because of it's previous release, but also because it's sound doesn't mesh with the other songs which are all very contemporary dirty pop. But aside from this, its a step in the right direction from everyone's favorite chest thumping Canadian diva.",4,1
2497156,The Other Woman by Hank Phillippe Ryan--an excellent read,"The book was extremely enjoyable.

As with any collection there were stories I really liked and some I could do without. Luckily most of these I liked. I found 'She Climbs a Winding Stair' to probably be my favorite, and I really dug the real estate story (can't recall the title) quite a bit as well. I also dug the afterword quite a bit. I kind of feel like I can relate to where Scott was when he was writing these stories. I'll def be picking up more from Nicholson.",5,1

Its not easy to put in the mini and take it out. You do have to wedge it in there and I wouldnt want to do it more than once or twice.The buttons are all accessible to me, but might be tough to get to for my 3 year old. Also the home button is a little tough to click on. But my son doesnt seem to mind.I would recommend this case for anyone under the age of 6.I give it 5 stars for my 3 year old.",5,1

514215,A WELL READ ROGUISH ROMANCE,"British actress Serena Gordon becomes the voice of Victoria, she's perfect.  Gordon is appropriately regal and reads this romance for teens and tweens with relish.Lady Victoria Arbutnot is a wealthy sixteen year old who knows her own mind, and thinks she knows everyone else's, too.  She's a privileged miss having grown up in India where she's been pampered and given her own way.  That comes to an abrupt halt when she's sent off to London to find a husband.Victoria doesn't waste a minute as she's barely aboard ship before she sets her eyes on and her cap for good looking Hugo Rothschild (he's the rogue of the title, although she doesn't know that yet).  He doesn't put up too much of a battle and their romance is off to a fine start.Ooops -  there's unexpected interference from the captain of the ship, Jacob Carstairs.  He's also young and handsome, and a self-appointed guardian of Victoria's heart and future.Listen to find just what that future may hold.- Gail Cooke",4,1

1496434,Haunting and beautiful,"This book is achingly honest, and so beautifully written, it reads like poetry.  If you look at Sting's vast lyric's catalog, this is not surprising, yet it is still a lovely revelation of his talent seen from a new perspective.It is vulnerable, without sinking into the realms of pity.  Startling sometimes, yet without artifice.  Baldly truthful without being arrogant or self-serving.  And in the end, it is so very readable.",5,1

If you are someone who bakes everything from scratch this book is not for you. However, for those of us who do not have that luxury, this little tidbit could really come in handy. There are a lot of really yummy ideas in the book that are easy to actually make. I also liked the ideas for the gift jars.

I bought this book because I'm thinking about starting a business in convenience/health food sector. I found his adventures and thoughts to be very interesting. He also talks about independently-owned businesses and shares his views and opinions on them.However, don't expect any concrete business development tips or lessons. This book is just about Erickson's life experiences and the lessons he learned along the way. Nevertheless, I found ""Raising the Bar"" to be an inspiring and worthwhile read for any young entrepreneur!",5,1

4057562,Hothouse,"I approached this book with much anticipation, and for much of it, was gratified.  The mood and setting are remarkably delineated.  Set in a remote ""hospital"" for women in a bleak 1920's Finland, Chapman fills the pages with sensuous detail clearly bringing to life the humid, hothouse atmosphere.  It is unclear why many of these women continue to take up bedspace in what purports to be a hospital, which includes a floor more like a private club for women who are bored, hysterical, or just plain trying to get away from their real lives.  Such indulgence is tolerated so long as their providers have the funds to keep them there, and their society is comforting for them, with the familiar faces, food, time in the sauna and games playing in the evenings.  The book is partially narrated in a first person collective, which gives an unsettling tone throughout, alerting the reader to plot developments, so that when there is a sudden shift, it is not entirely unexpected.",4,1

Joan Hickson is the quintessential Miss Marple and finds herself with an excellent supporting cast that enhances this classic whodunit.  A generous helping of romance and two deadly murders make this a most entertaining way to spend two hours. Mystery lovers will be challenged with the unexpected twists and red herrings that made the book so popular.  Was it the overzealous sister?  the genteel antiques collector?  the timid spinster?  the glamorous governess? the unhappy stepdaughter who evolves into Cinderella?  All is revealed on location in a picturesque English village.  Sit back and enjoy!",5,1
8822462,Mind-bending fun,"This is one of the coolest, most bizarrely funny movies I have ever seen. It stayed with me long after I left the movie theater, and I just wanted to view it again and again.  Charlie Kaufman wrote a brilliant screenplay and all the actors do a wonderful job as characters who develop such an anguish over their own existence.  I love that it is a totally original tale.  I recently added this DVD to my collection because it is one of my favorite movies of all time!",5,1

8733720,Puts nannies in a bad light,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give my thoughts on this movie...I find the thriller The Hand That Rocks The Cradle (1992) a great movie.  I saw it in the theater back in 1992 and was surprised by how good it was.  It stars Rebecca DeMornay, Annabella Sciorra, Matt McCoy, Ernie Hudson, Madeline Zima, and Julianne Moore.  When I think of Rebecca DeMornay, I think her playing the role of Mrs. Mott in this movie.  She did a fantastic job as the nut case nanny.My favorite character in the movie is the aggressive, busy body Marlene, played by Julianne Moore.  My favorite line of the movie is when Marlene says, ""Figure it out.  You've got a Harvard education"".  Some of the scenes are flat out unbelievable and laugh-out-loud funny, such as when Claire and Michael take back the bike they gave to Solomon (played by Ernie Hudson) as a gift.Overall, this is a great thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I highly recommend it.",5,1
9275338,Better than Frozen,"I just watched the movie 'Frozen' last night and wrote a review saying it did not deserve even the one star I was forced to give it.  Buried I'd say is worth the one star, but only because of Ryan Renolds acting, although renting it on Blu-Ray thinking it might be of better quality I have to say it isn't worth the extra cost.  The movie has no point whatever unless it was trying to convince Americans not to go to countries like Irag or Afganistan in civilian jobs to make presumably a lot of money.  In the end the company Renold's character works for sells him out so as not to have to pay the insurance when he turns up dead. Add to the lack of substance, a margin of gore to the Nth degree and you have yourself a one star movie.",1,0

They are a little tight and uncomfortable at first, but i have worn them for four hours total and they have become more relaxed and comfortable each time i wear them. Sound is great, i use them when playing, Forza5, Titanfall, & CoD: Ghosts. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a decent headset that provides good quality sound! This Headset ALSO comes with the Xbox One chat adapter, so that you can use an older headset if you wish.",4,1

Without giving away too much about the plot, it is obvious that there are sequels planned because there are too many questions unanswered.....such as: why is Penryn able to brandish Raffie's sword?

4199994,Enchantment is not just for fairy tales,Many books receive all sorts of great hype only to leave the reader disappointed from some rehashed information; this is not one of those books. Guy has done a fantastic job in laying out a book that can actually help the reader. You will find a path that explains how to become more passionate about what you do as well as how to really help people around you.There are plenty of examples of how to be more persuasive in both theory but also in the ability to really communicate with others on a higher level. There are also short stories at the end of each chapter that underscore what the chapter was about. The formulas used for success are also easy to follow but even better they would be easy to implement.There is some thinking involved on your part as a reader but that is one of the many reasons that this is an exceptional read.,5,1

Mr. Strand was certainly at his best. I honestly kept wondering how a man can sit (or stand), write such humorous dialogue and situations, and keep the story fresh, interesting, and moving along with a good rate of speed.This book had few to zero editing problems. I found no grammar errors, misspelled words, or crazy mixed up subjective/objective useage.  While not an all out horror, there were many horrific scenes.Highly recommend",5,1

Two damaged people helping to free one another and finally finding a way to love each other freely. Archer, a man without a speaking voice, but with a voice so loud it was impossible not to hear him, not to love him. Bree, the one person who could actually see him, who wanted to see him, helping him to unlock that place inside of him that, even though he didn't know it, was aching to come out.I love the beauty in the simplicity, the smallest things in life can make the longest lasting impression.

Tony is slowly being poisoned by the palladium in his arc reactor, until he can find a replacement. He soon develops a drinking problem. During a race at Monaco, Tony is attacked by Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. Whiplash teams up with a weapons manufacturer to perfect a line of armored combat units that will upstage Tony. The units begin to attack, which are remote-controlled by Whiplash. Iron Man must team up with War Machine in order to save the day. I highly recommend IRON MAN 2!!!",4,1

The plot of this film involves two warring space dynasty's fighting for over magical spice, which is an obvious reference to people warring over oil.... And guess what? It happens in a desert, it's so obvious. This film is such a muddled mess of Dune it's just sad. It's been years since i read the original book, so i don't remember if a large amount of what happens in this film happens in the book.It's a horrid disaster, and it totally bombed at the box office. Maybe it's due to David Lynch trying to inject the David Lynch feel into the feel, maybe that's why we get things like Heart Plugs. I mean were those in the books?

It is worthy of note.Tah is a young chinese boy who is regrettably a soldier. He dreams of spinning tops and kites and things a young boy is supposed to be amused with rather than war. Quite a poignant story offering very personally the futility and waste of life in war. Especially, when it is not participated in really by one's own choice or purpose.The story Tah was L Ron Hubbard's first published story, and I suspect is more true to his own feelings of war as he mentioned in later writing's he admitted he knew some things when he was a young man....Wonderfully enacted and dramatized in the Audiobook!!",5,1

What I loved most was how Mathis carefully crafted the characters as each character steps forward to move the story along.

9288630,My First Faust,"Never saw Faust before but got this since I always trust the work of Alagna & Gheourgiu.  It was wonderful & I really enjoyed the staging & the singing but I have to agree with one of the other reviewers that you could find some of the scenes a bit offensive if you are more conservative in your viewing.  There's a scene where women lick blood off of a ""bleeding"" crucifix - I get that it was representing the devil's doing but some may find it a bit much.  What I had trouble with was the scene where they had the talents of their incredible ballet company completely wasted by having the lot of them rolling around on the ground having pretty graphic simulated sex.  I just thought it went further than it had to & I wanted to see the dancers DANCE, not roll around on the ground.  So for that I give it 4 stars but if something like that wouldn't bother you than it is definitely a 5 star production.",4,1

8721636,Disappointing Blu-Ray Quality,"I have both the DVD and just this week received the Blu-Ray version. The HD quality is lacking. Most notably in the hanger deck scenes near the end where it shows Laskey walking to the helicopter when Senator Chapman and Ms. Scott are being taken to Pearl Harbor and again when the bombs are being loaded (same camera angle). In addition, the interior shots during the ship's medical department scenes show a poor quality. The center of the screen is HD but the outer edges (a good portion not just a tiny section) is totally out of focus for the entire scenes of the Japanese prisoner taking a hostage and killing crew members. It is very apparent the scene was either poorly shot or the HD conversion was not completed.The movie itself is fantastic!

3825874,WOOSAH!!!!,"I really don't know where to start with this review. When I found out what this book was about, I really did not want to read it. At the insistence of some friends and the author, I continued to read. During this read, I went thru several emotions from being upset, angry and just plain mad. Author Boo Jackson wrote this book in such a believable fashion, that I had to look at some of her pictures just to make sure that she was African American. She wrote this book from the eyes of a Klansman and wrote it as if she was in that body. I recommend that you read this book and let your children and grandchildren read this book. There is so much history in this book and this story needs to be told. It is not for the faint. Enlighten your kids and let them know what people had to endure so that they will know the struggle. Great Job Boo!!!!! I am a FAN for life now.",5,1
2653344,Fun Look Back,"Seth Davis's WHEN MARCH WENT MAD is a very fun book to read. The first two-thirds of the book is classic. In fact, if Davis could have found an ending I would rank it with A SEASON ON THE BRINK as college basketball's greatest inside look. But, the book's ending is much like the 1979 championship game itself, somewhat anti-climatic. Still, Davis writes exceptionally well and the pages turn quickly.Apart from the book itself, my only real complaint is that when I received it in the mail from Amazon.com the binding of the book was cracked with the first few pages ready to fall out. Thereafter the book wouldn't close properly until I ripped the offending pages out. Not what you expect when you purchase a book new.",4,1

My daughter loves the book, and answers 'where's my sleepy baby?' each time by seeming to hug herself and say her version of 'me'.  The last couple of pages aren't as interesting as the rest [to me - my daughter's fine with them], but my daughter loves the book, and the repetition and wording are perfect for bedtime.

1401516,Rochelle Alers - Manof Fortune,"As usual I enjoy reading Rochelle Alers books. The entire series was enjoyable. It is lightweight reading filled with romance. It's fiction so don't get it twisted. I like to read about prosperous strong Black men and like to fantasize about the way Rochelle's men treat Black women. They are always financially secure and have lasting/bonding friendships with other Black men of the same caliber. The world is so full of crime and negativity that I read Ms. Aler's books to escape. If you are looking for escapism and romance, then I would highly recommend this series.",4,1
3070663,Excellent Young Adult Book!,"I like to read some of my oldest child's books, and I must say that this is one of the better ones. &#34;The Legend of the Blue Eyes&#34; was a different type of vampire style book. I loved the way the author described all of the different creatures in this story with so much detail, as there were much more than just vampires. The main character, Arianna Grace is a strong and powerful young female that will be a great role model for the young girls who read this trilogy. I highly recommend this exciting book.",5,1

I particularly enjoy the way he describes something. His word choices bring to life the setting, the action, and the emotions of his characters.

However, the last cut on this CD seems to answer me when I say I want more, and it is like House speaking to me musically... You Can't Always Get What You Want, performed by Hugh Lurie's band, Band from TVThe  soundtrack is not a hit driven musical pieces. These 12 cuts fit the House tome. The music is somber and bittersweet, just like the show.

Many of the techniques and ideas in this book would have made things a lot easier.If you want to simplify your life (and believe me, if you do you will be a lot happier!) then this is a great book to read. It's very easily laid out and the ideas are great.

While I was left wanting more of Daphne and Hartwell, their relationship and development of their feelings is believable for the short length.The love of a good woman is exactly what Hartwell needs to overcome stuttering and step out into the ton. Daphne is the perfect match for him. Her personality is just right to draw out the side of Hartwell he didn't even know existed.Hartwell isn't an alpha male. However, his weaknesses and lack of socializing added to his character. An alpha male wouldn't have worked as Daphne's hero. Since she is a widow, she more daring and outspoken for this era.I recommend this book to any reader looking for a quick historical romance that sizzles.4 Stars - A Great ReadNote: I requested this book from Net Galley.",4,1

I only wish they could have had some ""special features"" like behind the scenes, some out takes, etc, commentaries, etc. That would have been great!

This is the first series of Brooks that I read where the character development is superb and there is a heavy dose of reality mixed in with the fantasy (dealing with issues of death, intimacy, etc.)...  I don't like reviews that give away the story. That's why you read the book... so, with that said, I think this book is worth the read if you are a fan of fantasy without being overzealous.

Carla is extremely naive for her age and painfully shy. Dr. Miller is hot and clueless when it comes to his past relationship with Tish.

5951706,The music is better than the film!,"The Hours is a very good film, but the music is so good that it makes the film seem more extraordinary than it actually is. I saw it at a theatre and, as is usually the case, it was much more impressive than when seen at home. Those who have the soundtrack will notice that the music in the film is significantly different in some places; the songs are the same, but they have different effects, like glockenspeil.The only thing that would make this music better is if some of it would have a slower progression of ideas in the tracks. This issue is particularly apparent in the Solaris soundtrack (by Cliff Martinez), and less of a problem with this one. I've heard some Glass that I absolutely detest (Music in Twelve Parts) because it's so repetative and tacky. The music here is nothing like that.

Both have secrets, secrets they don't share and that could keep them from being together. Jenna is a single Mom and has a crush on Matt but he seems immune to her. Matt isn't immune, he's just protecting his heart. He doesn't get involved with a single Moms because when things don't work out he loses more than just the relationship, he loses the kids as well.Now, I've said this with each book in this series, the characters are real and so well written, complex but easy to understand. You feel connected and invested in every word! This book is sweet and romantic, suspensful at times and you will sit on the edge of your seat and possibly lose a little sleep because you won't want to put it down, I know I was up way past my bed time reading this one!",5,1
7554372,Dexter approved,Dexter is my roommate and likes to keep our knives sharp. He says this thing really sharpens them so they cut well. He and I highly recommends this to all knives specialists to improve the slicing ability of your knives. I do a lot of cooking so it helps to cut stuff. I'm not sure what Dexter does but he sure doesn't cook.,5,1

9021451,Lone Gunmen a great add on to X Files,"This is a great though short lived series trying to playoff of the X Files. It uses the same nutty characters you find in the X Files (The Lone Gunmen) and continues to deal with conspiracy type stories. Unfortunately, I think the TV world had burned out on conspiracy by the time this came out.",4,1
9081725,Another wondeful show canceled before it's time,"I remember enjoying this show when it came out. It was around the same period as Hercules, Firefly, Xena, just after Brisco, Buffy...etc. Back when there were so many great action, adventure, comedy shows on TV. This one was more of a screwball comedy, harking back to the road shows of Hope and Crosby. The writing ranges from low brow to witty, yet always funny. I'm enjoying this show more now than it's original airing, perhaps due to the huge void in television created by sub par sitcoms and reality TV. It's a shame there aren't shows like this anymore.This show, is very funny, has entertaining adventure, and surprisingly great production values, anyone who enjoys comedy and adventure (and doesn't mind if it's played a little broad) will find this series to be an absolute treat. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",5,1
2853568,New spiritual paths,"Star Child is the author's third book, each book takes you on a different spiritual journey. This book is filled with layered teachings about the gods and the network of Light upon the earth. It is an adventurous and entertaining story. It is a book that you need to read more than once because it is so packed with teaching that you will miss a lot the first time. It takes you on a journey along new spiritual paths, that not many have been on before. I highly recommend it.",5,1

Althoug it exclusively deals with what he describes as high potential startups, much can be learned about the inner workings of a start up company.  If you are interested in learning about startups, even if you might not consider yours a ""high potential"" startup, it is still a must read.  This book takes you inside the startups and provides detailed information about how early decisions can have disasterous effects later in the life of the company.  It is research based and is NOT one of those ""start your own company and make a million dollars"" books.  The read is a little dry, but it is packed with valuable information. After all, he is a professor of business not literature.  Great book at a decent price.  Well Done!",5,1
6101711,McCartney in DTS,"Super DVDs!  McCartney never sounded or looked better.  The DTS sound choice will be missed by those not having DTS equipment, but probably sounds good in plain old stereo.  McCartney's showing his age these days, but it's nostalgic to see him in his prime in these DVDs.Love the unplugged numbers with the gorgeous harmonies from AWB's Hamish Stuart (?).  It looks like him.  Pulls a few numbers from the McCartney LP, well done.Wish there were more numbers from the Wings Over America LPs, but everyone has their ""druthers.""  Super DVDs!",5,1

Chosmky is, in my opinion one of the greatest minds in the past 100 years. His ability to take the case of social justice to the average American, who has been blinded by a massive propaganda campaign by reactionary forces are truly commendable.  Chomsky is a true intellectual, a genious, a man of first-rate intelligence. Did I mention you ought to buy this book IMMEDIATLY??",5,1

4225282,A rare treasure,"This book is a rare treasure. As a dog lover, an amateur student of Japanese history, and a resident of Japan, I found it irresistable. It provides great information about a relatively unknown place in Japan, even to Japanese folks. It also chronicles a period of time in Japanese history from an unusual vantage point. The book is an excellent book for dog lovers, but it's about much more than that. It details incredible human relationships in tight, hypnotic verse, it tells about the most beautiful areas in Japan, and it tells about the changing dynamics of Japanese marriage. I read it from cover to cover, totally unable to put it down. A must read!",5,1

8408775,Love.. Emma Lauren,"Wow! How to write a review without giving away too much of the plot!The story begins with what I thought would be an illicit relationship between Sydney and her college professor, which I was happy to get into. I have no idea why, but I love the forbidden teacher/student romances, call me twisty.Then enters Henry and throws all my ill conceived plans out the window! I loved Henry from the get go, he was funny and kind and such a great friend to Sydney.What I loved most was that I had no idea where Emma was going with the story, Sydney has some major issues because of her past and she is good at keeping them hidden; I was seriously worried for her throughout the story.I can't wait for the next installment. Well done Emma!",5,1
1203459,Enjoyable and Fast Paced Read!,"I really enjoyed this book. It was an enjoyable and fast paced read. It kept me glued and wondering where it was going to go next, although some parts of it you could figure out before they got there. The climax to me seemed to come more towards the end of the book and then just get wrapped up too quickly with things between Haller and Roulet. I think there could have been more twists and turns at that point and it could have been taken just a little bit farther. I was a tad disappointed with the ending, I felt that after all Michael Haller went through, he should have made a better career choice at the end ( hope I'm not giving too much away ). Now that I've read the book, I'm definitely ready to see the movie and I truly hope it lives up to the book.",5,1

1762442,Camel Club Personified,"David Baldacci has written a sequel to the Camel Club series in his usual remarkable form. The parallel action story-line was riveting. No author in my experience can successfully tell two completely separate stories at the same time, interspersing characters and activity at a micro level, as does Baldacci.Explaining the biography of Oliver Stone/John Carr in this book concerns me as an avid fan as to Baldacci's plans to continue the Camel Club series.  However, if he does not, the true enjoyment of having read all four books most assuredly allows me to give props the author deserves.Having introduced Annabelle as an addition to the group awhile back added a new dimension and certainly tickles the imagination of what might be, should future books be written. My recommendation is absolute, but it also includes reading the entire Camel Club series from the beginning.",4,1
8414456,Another big star for Micalea!!!,"I loved this series.  I actually love all of Micalea Smeltzer's work.  This series just snuck up on me and I don't know how.  It was just there.  I usually follow / stalk (you choose the word) her work and it was just there like a great big Xmas surprise!  It was a sweet and enjoyable story.  I loved it and the details that Micalea is so good at, make a great book into a memorable one.  When you read as much as I do, it is easy to have books sort of blend into each other over time (which is great because i can reread many of them) but she places details that keep her books in front and center.  I don't see a plaid shirt without thinking of Trace from these books. The grandfather, OH!!! who wouldn't wish for one of him  His character was so  heartwarming that he was as lovable as Trace - well almost...  Read this series and her others for yourself - I do not think you will walk away being anything other then another follower / stalker (you choose the word) like I am.",5,1

3574459,Fantastic book,"I feel that Kiana Davenport is in league with the great modern writers. She should be at least as well known as Barbara Kingsolver.  Her depth of characters, ability to explore the suffering of humanity, and the redemption that is found is stunning.Also, this book contains history of the civil war I had never known of such as the southern women growing poppies for the opium 'bullseyes' they used to prop up the soldiers for the war. Fascinating and profoundly moving, with great storyline. Davenport always well researches her novels to bring little known facts to the story. She is a great writer that leaves one deeply satisfied as a reader.",5,1
5736223,Great listening for a rainy day.,"Hayden's album, 'Everything I Long For', captures the simplicity of a man and his guitar at its best. His songs are unique in that each is a story. Excellent song writing abilities helps him to narrate his feelings and  experiences which are beautifully backed mostly by his acoustic guitar,  with some electric guitar, piano, cello and harmonica. A somewhat somber  album, however, Hayden is still able to capture the feelings most people  have sometime in their lives dealing with family and relationships. Two  such songs on the album, 'We don't mind', about a couple whom both call in  sick to work just so they can spend the day together, and 'Hardly', about  seeing someone you are attracted to, wanting to get to know them, but being  too afraid to go up to them and introduce yourself. These two songs happen  to be at the top of my most favorites. The whole album is equally enjoyable  and has a very relaxing overall effect. I listen to this album often and I  recommend it to anyone.",5,1
2651670,A gripping account of what it was like to be in the face of death,"I've read many books on the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the United States, but this is the first one I've read on the horrors that took place within the confines of the World Trade Center towers. It presents a gripping account of what it was really like for the individuals who faced death as they were trapped in the towers on that fateful day. This is an astounding story of courage and survival. The authors do an astounding job of detailing exactly what took place on that awful day. Be prepared for this book to have a significant impact on you, as it did for me. This is an essential book for anyone who lived through that horrible day in American history.",5,1
4249317,The Portable Patriot,"The Portable PatriotDocuments, Speeches, and Sermons That Compose the American SoulBy Joel Miller and Kristen ParrishThis book came around Memorial Day and I have taken the time to digest it.  It was a wonderful book full of different speeches and documents that trace America's Christian heritage.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  It was set up in chronological order and was a very interesting read.  It makes it easy to trace our heritage and also you can then look up time-lines and see what was going on in America's history at the time each document was made.  Also the authors put in background for the documents and speeches.  As it was original documents it has a very colorful and vivid language which we have lost.  It makes wonderful oral reading to share with older children.  As it is ""portable"" as it's name says it makes great reading in the car!!  It also makes some wonderful conversation starters for the family.  It is a book that I would recommend with much gusto!",5,1
9345022,Hilarious!,"Great movie continuing the trend for Dr Seuss films (with the sad exclusion of the live action Cat In The Hat).  This film departs from the recent trend to bring young children's books to the screen with live action (Grinch, Cat In The Hat, Where The Wild Things Are) and for good reason.  With the sole exception of the Grinch (possibly due to the incredible casting of that film), these books don't translate all that well into live action and leave the viewer wondering who they were made for.This doesn't do that.  It is lots of fun and while the territory has been plumbed by many others, this version of the envronmental/ecology story stands up very well.  Only Wall-E did it better.",5,1
1017221,Fun to read,"Christian fondlementalists notwithstanding, I believe anyone from their young teens to their early hundreds would enjoy this superb story. Pullman stuffed an entire Oxford education into his pipe and blew out a whopper.

The characters are outrageous and fascinating, and the worlds they live in are full of surprises. Throughout the trilogy and almost to the very end, Pullman continually adds layers to the story, making it a rich page-turner you will whip through with delight.",5,1

I loved the plot, I never hear that many of Alices songs and I quite liked what he used in this movie. While the monster could have been improved, because it all just seemed as one big puppet (good looking, though), it wasn't quite that bad.

The smaller size takes some adjustment, but I am used to the laptop keypad, so this was not a big problem. After two days I'm quite happy with it. Only downside I can see is that the arrow keys are replaced with one toggle key. Takes some coordination. But again, nothing I can't adjust to. Would like to be able to find some mention of battery life. You can turn the keyboard on and off, but is it necessary? There is little said on the subject.I love the compact size, and the look of it. It's solidly built and very quiet (which was my biggest complaint about the Dell.) And the price is very reasonable compared to other models. I wish I had bought it through Amazon, but I was in a situation that I wanted it immediately, so the extra $15 or so that I paid for the list priced item was worth it.",4,1

Pacing was good, and kept me reading. Progress of the investigation was credible. Characters were interesting and intelligent. Ending is a nail-biter and highly satisfying.Two negatives in my opinion: some gratuitous cursing; also I've read mysteries that are slightly more uniformly gripping, though I'd put this one in the top quartile for ""grippingness"".Very entertaining.

A great addition to his previous works has a little repetition and although he discusses the Tippet murder may have several reasons, I believe Henry Hurt's to be the most plausible.  This book is a must read for anyone with serious interest in the case.  Great job, Harry, Sincerely,  Chris Petit",5,1
5917231,One word--Amazing!,"Josh Groban's self titled CD is wonderful. The singing is amazing and the background music.  It will give you chills it is so well made and sang.  I never thought I would be a fan of Josh Groban but I saw him on PBS one and I was blown away.  He rotates proudly in my CD player and gets jammed in my car.  I really enjoy him!  I can't wait to see him live!  He is so amazing on CD and television I might pass out from his wonderfulness at the concert!  I recommend everyone give him a chance he proudly sits in my music collection.  And is right next to CDs that are not even in his genre-punk- so I suggest everyone give him a chance the clips on here are an good introduction to Josh's music, but if you are still debating I would check him out at your library or record store and you will be so amazed you will buy his CD right away!",5,1
5351421,Cute idea,"Cute idea, but just didn't work well. The story didn't flow well, the dialog was stilted.  Jack just seemed unreal, following Nicky around like a puppy dog for 10 plus years while she used him for everything but sex,  she went with boyfriend after boyfriend and he never failed in his devotion to her....kinda unbelievable.",2,0

As for the extras, eh. They're alright. There's certainly more than for season 1. The commentaries can be occasionally boring, or at least completely unaware of the stuff that fans would want to hear about. Really, if Chase isn't talking, it's not going to be as enlightening as it could be. Even so, if you're a fan of film or literature, you have to own this. You owe it to yourself and your future progeny. Seriously.",5,1
2427639,Even Better Than the Last Entry in the Series,"Really quite happy with this Simply Sarah series. In addition to hitting all the marks for the targeted reading ability group, the author effortlessly incorporates other contemporary themes that were oddities when I was young reader.In this book we meet Sarah once again, who lives with her single mother and young brother. This time the reader gets to meet a friend who is living with her aunt and uncle because her parents died in an earthquake. This is in addition to the last book of getting to know Peter who lives with his grandmother. These dynamics are ones that are reflective of the familiar situations of many of the likely readers of this story and it's excellent that so many children will have an opportunity to identify with one or more characters.As with the other book, Sarah once again has a 'problem' and once again goes about thinking in a variety of critical ways to solve it.Really shaping up to be a cute and enduring series for the young, confident reader.",4,1

6490912,Not for traveling,"I got this radio a couple of years ago after reading the reviews. If it sat on a shelf and I didn't have to take it on my travels, it might be OK.

Emilie Richards' plot presents the present world and dips into the past that contributed to the story's current events. The sister's choice in this novel gives the reader insight into the power of sisterly love and redemption. Richards' characters are likable, realistic and inclined to the good, light-filled side of life, a refreshing change from so many books that dabble in darkness of character. I really liked it.  - Sweetbriar Queen",5,1

Instead of Johnny Cash we've got Jeff Jarrett on the poster now. Jeff didn't actually wrestle at Slammiversary however.I was at this event in Nashville, TN. It was a good pro wrestling pay-per-view.I got a kick out of watching the DVD extra that showed the fans at the T.N.A. Fanfest standing in line and then later meeting the wrestlers. I met Kevin Nash and Kurt Angle there. WWE should do the same thing before every PPV.Hard to believe that this PPV marked the five-year anniversary of TNA. I loved it when they ran a PPV every Wednesday night at the Nashville Fairgrounds.",5,1

It's a touching love story, the acting is a little amateur like, but it makes this film still worth watching. There are just 2 kinds of reviewers here, either they love it or hate it. I'm one of those loving it.",4,1

Her life completely revolved around herself and even afterwards, she couldn't conceive what she'd done wrong and why she couldn't have a relationship with her children.  Very sad.",4,1

1907300,Challenging in many ways,"This is a challenging and difficult book in many senses. It challenges our beliefs, whether we hold firmly to a version of God, or to a secular faith in no God. It challenges us whether we see science as the only Way, or doubt science as the way. It is a work of science, religion, faith, doubt, philosophy, and ethics, humanism and humanity. It challenges us because the thinking and feeling are deep and challenging in themselves. It is challenging because sometimes, like Kant, Kauffman seems unnecessarily dense in his writing. But this is a book well worth reading, no matter where you begin, or end.",5,1
2599013,Pink isn't such a bad color after all,"I wasn't sure whether I'd like this book since it appeared to be marketed to African-American females, and I'm Asian-American. Luckily I was proven wrong.  ""Pink"" was a breezy refreshing read.  The characters seemed real, not preachy or annoying and actually relatable.  It was very cool to find out what goes on inside the fashion design world and how a small business operates.  And it was very nice to to see the story from Flex's POV and not just assuming what he was thinking from Raya.  Looking foward to reading Jade!",5,1
4655214,Where's the rest of it?,"I had high hopes for this book.  Firstly, I love any lycan story, but I also like my characters to have backbone.  By that I mean, they don't just willingly believe you without putting up a fight to figure things out themselves. Secondly, there was no development of the characters really.  It was a hey-I'm-a-wolf-you're-my-mate-let's-get-busy.  There was supposed to be a big fight scene, though when it boiled down to it, was nothing more than a few paragraphs.I got this as a freebie book, I was a little interested in what happens to the characters because of the abrupt ending.  You're reading along expecting to meet the pack, expecting so much more and BAM!  You're at the end of the book. Admittedly, I don't think I paid any attention to the length of this book. I would love to find out what happened to the characters, but I'm not going to pay $2.99 for 90 more pages. Not when I could spend the same for a book with 345 pages and a better story line.  I feel like this title just left the readers hanging.",2,0

By the time he died - eaten by the Hawaiians, with only his thigh bone and uneated hands, one of them bearing a recognizable scar, delivered back to the ship - he had mapped essentially all of the unknown surface of the Earth.  This biography is beautifully written.  A few months ago I was sitting at a bar in Cook Islands, reading this book, and a local said to me that he had bought about 20 copies to hand out to his boatie friends.  You are in for hours of discovery and enjoyment.",5,1

1299483,Twisted and Dark FBI story - not a romance!,Twisted story of suspense. A serial killer is killing women in an exceptionally gruesome way. He tortures and plays with them first. He then leaves them wrapped in plastic for the law to find. The FBI is brought in and the killer steps it up by taunting the cops by leaving bodies close to their homes and lives. I knew by about the end of the second chapter who the bad guy was. It was frustrating to see the characters play so dumb to the clues I obviously figured out. Good book but very dark with lots of death. Not for those with a weak stomach. One of the better books I've read this month.,4,1
8924810,Great movie!,"This is a great example of the early 80s Euro-gore movies. I saw it at the drive-in when it came out, and then ob VHS as Dr Butcher MD. There is a lot of grain in the movie, especially in the darker scenes, which is typical of movies shot on film. I think this enhances the viewing experience. Down with digital and CGI, this is what a horror movie should look like.",5,1
2467600,Inspiration at its best,"An inspiring story of how faith can guide you in the most desperate of situations. Ms. Tuff gave insight to her inner most feelings and how her faith helped her in her life and how she used what she believed in to help someone else.  It was not only a story of a critical situation at a school with a possible horrible outcome, but a touching story of a woman who put aside all her own personal adversities to help someone else.I enjoyed the joining of two stories-one being the trying times of a wonderful woman & one of a helpless young man--as a truly great read.",5,1
5850762,Extol is mesmerizing !,"I haven't been much into black metal, but when I first played this it all came to me, this cd is awesome. Fast drumming, stunning vocals and gripping guitars. It only has 6 songs, but for 6 bucks it's a good deal. And every  song is good. I highly recommend this cd. If you like Borgir or Simon  Dimmu, this would be an excellent alternative. What's most catching is how  good and talented they are, for a new band that is young. If you like hard  metal that's a different than what's average get this cd.",5,1

I am a psychotherapist and since I read the book have started sharing it with my female clients especially 18 to 30 age range with great results. Sarah DeAnna's informative, funny yet kind voice throughout really speaks to women who are bombarded by images of 'perfection' day in and day out. Coming from a real life SuperModel (they recognize her from magazines they read!) really holds weight with my younger clientele. Yes to empowering our young women and a big YES to SupeModel YOU!

It's the fastest I've ever finished a book as I tend to have ADD and take longer than 2 weeks go finish even a great novel. This book was so fun to read. And interesting and emotional. I really connected with the characters. It's not so detailed that the book becomes long, draggy and uninteresting. It stays young, fun, and fresh from page 1 through the end. There were times at the end of most sections, the author would absolutely leave me at the edge of my seat yearning for more info.  Highly recommended. Love Madeleine's style!",5,1

4973721,"""Super"" heroes","I am really becoming a fan of the ""Beat To a Pulp"" series, and this installment is a good reason to be.  From characters that are super-powered to normal people in extraordinary circumstances, ""BTAP-Superhero"" is a gritty, sometimes hyper-violent look into these characters lives. Admittedly, this is a little different than most hard-boiled, pulp fiction, but definitely in a good way. I recommend it!",4,1
5321662,It deserves 4 1/2,This is a very clever story of a post apocalyptic - outer space type.  There is a somewhat type love interest goingon in the background but that really does not play a big role.  I was hooked from the start when the main characterwakes up with no memories on a ship full of dead people.  There of course is a lot of gore and crazy creatures - conspiracytheories and military bases and the military portions are very realistic.

6651968,Quality construction. Very bad instructions.,"1st I would like to thanks amazon for making purchase of TV mount so easy, based on reviews. I didn't compare this one with anything else. Simply picked it up based on the fact that it was #1 seller at that time with good reviews.Also noticed that few people complained about instructions being very vague. I can concur with them. Instructions are vague. It won't say which parts to use for Concrete walls VS what to use for drywall. Their attempt to provide graphical representation of installation procedure does help a little bit, but it can be improved. It costs 1 star from review.About the mount itself, it is built solid. Once mounted on wall, feels secure, sturdy that I can trust my expensive LED to it. Comes with Quality HDMI cable about 10 ft. All in all, good purchase.",4,1

This case is perfect for those occasions when I want to use the pen only. I'm left handed, and it works fine in that orientation. The only downside is that the stand is not stable in the 'low rise' configuration: Normal pressure of fingers on screen will make the flap slip out of position and the stand will collapse. This can be fixed by pulling the elastic strap behind the vertical part of the low rise stand, which keeps everything snugly in place, but it puts quite a strain on that strap.",4,1

8777401,Misogyny and lousy direction sink movie,"This film doesn't just pale in comparison to its cyberpunk cousins &quot;Bladerunner&quot; or &quot;12 Monkeys,&quot; it turns ghostly white and dies.  The film misses the mark because it can't decide what it's aiming for, and so it resorts to tired old Hollywood formulas.  For example, the film nominally decries misogyny while at the same time offering viewers voyeuristic scenes of women being murdered, raped, groped, and screwed. (And that's when they're not stripping and standing around 90-100% nude.) Bassett's strength gives the movie some female force, but only by putting her macho boots up the noses of the bad guys and gals.  Interestingly, the film portends the LA police's CRASH unit--a murderous group of fascists which has come to public light since this film was made.  But that real story of CRASH is far more horrifying than this weak drama.",2,0

I have read a few reviews that liked the first book better but I disagree and think the masterpiece is in Fugue State.

More like a running catalog of no-restriction shopping and over-done curtains -- always a bad sign -- and to make matters even worse, it's all photographed in absurdly overly-propped settings, better suited to a cook book than to the work of, dare I repeat it, ""American's Best Designers.""Compared to Jan Shower's excellent ""Glamorous Rooms,"" which arrived at the same time, this one would be a profound disappointment if it weren't just so -- silly.Recommendation: Avoid at all costs.

It was actually a movie, ""The Good Girl"" with Jennifer Aniston and Jake Gylenhall, that prompted me to finally sit down and read this book. First of all, the book has no plot. Second of all, I'd heard all about Holden's teen angst but it seemed less angst more teen obnoxiousness to me. Holden was a bored, spoiled, rich kid who didn't like anything. That's basically the essence of the book. Still, as much as I tried not to, I liked the book. I chuckled and smiled and looked forward to reading Holden's ""take"" on the world around him even though I thought he was a bit of a phony.",4,1

I don't get why the stars are not listed in the Amazon info, though, and why the older, 2000 dvd is labeled blu-ray.I was right outa college in 1963, and summered in a similar place. The spirit and sound of the film are period perfect.  Swayze and Grey are a perfect film couple; they are sympathetic characters with great chemistry.  The standard Hollywood conventions and devices mount up by the end, spoiling the ""willing suspension of disbelief"".  For a while, though, you can forget this is a Hollywood movie.  Regardless of its increasing implausibility as the film barrels along, I still felt tears well up at the finale.",4,1

The concept is simple:  kids read and ""interact"" with a series of dots.  The book asks them to press, blow, shake and clap which makes the dots change and move.  By ""magic"" the dots react to the kids movements and actions.  I have a 3 year old son who just loves this book - he's charmed by all the action and loves being part of the story.

The story and plot was very enjoyable, but what made the book awesome to me was the fact that Tabitha, the main lady character was not perfect in her looks. She was not drop dead gorgeous, she had some insecurities, but she still has spunk and drive and spirit.

Jake still needs to restore the box of stones to receive his full power as Keeper which will hopefully be the advantage they need to win this war.

Important people want to use him for their own evil ends and Shale must learn to make his own way in the world.The supporting cast is Terelle; a slave girl fleeing the life of a courtesan. She has mysterious powers which might rival that of a Stormlord.I like this book because the Shale and Terelle are just ordinary people trying to live ordinary lives but having a hard time of it because they were born to poor circumstances. Also they have their dreams. Shale might become the next Stormlord and Terelle might be something that rivals a Stormlord. It is very easy to relate to them.",5,1

I happen to love country music and Lori writes songs or artists names into the story and this one she even made some online friends characters in the story. I especially love how she writes 4 year old Buck's words, because he can't say his &#34;r's she writes them as &#34;w's&#34; as a small child would sound. This book deals with a Marine, and is very well described about how some military may deal with PTSD and adjusting to life at home.

This book is full of absurdities. It's rare for someone to write so effortlessly about such utter reckless abandonment of priorities and the basics of our humanity. This book, from beginning to end, is absolutely ridiculous. The characters (showing how talented Burroughs truly is) are believable, their obsessions, insecurities and the messes they get into, mirror those of average people. Burroughs manages to tell an incredibly cruel, absurd and gross tale that perfectly depicts the plight of so many but under an extra-bright spotlight and in a frame of a big, sparkly, fake grin.",4,1

The movie stayed very close to the book, though some of the secondary characters' detail was either cut from the final or not fleshed out. But there's so much going on in the book that relates to the desires of adults not wanting to embrace their responsibilities both as parents and partners. Perrotta's sparse writing style packs a wallop though. You feel like you're in the room, whether it's during the intimacy of a sexual tryst between the characters or during the discomfort they feel at a dinner party with their spouses. There's a lot to like and learn from here, while the tale weaves in and out of dark humor and ironic passages. Check this book out. I look forward to now reading Election (which became the brilliant Reese Witherspoon/Matthew Broderick film) and Joe College.",5,1

Not for everyone but a good movie.  There is an unrated version; which I'm not sure what more could be added, as this ""R"" rated one features quite a bit of controversial material (Nudity, Lesbianism, Drug Use).

Could even see Aaron Paul of Breaking Bad playing the lead in the movie version. If I had to critique the story, I would say the last third of the book seemed a bit rushed. Plot moved too fast to reach its conclusion. Only other criticism would be that Mr. Sheridan needs to flesh out his characters and settings more.

829024,"Shines in its plausible plot, in details and suspense","If we are not fearful enough, than Fredrick Forsyth reminds us that the terrorists have the money, the skills and, most importantly, the patience needed to meticulously plan horrific acts designed to destroy our open societies. Although more of a history lesson than the traditional thriller, The Afghan shines in its plausible plot, in details and suspense.When the British and the American intelligent services learn of a plot known only as Al-Isra (the enlightenment of Mohammad), they conceive of a daring plan to infiltrate Al-Qaeda. They recruit the recently retired Col Mike Martin (of the superb Fist of God) to impersonate Izmat Khan, an Afghan Taliban commander. From Afghanistan of the 1980s to the Saudi-financed maddarasses in Pakistan where young men are brainwashed into hatred, Forsyth trails the rise of the Islamic terror groups. Still the master of the spy genre, Forsyth has the exceptional ability to transform dry data into an engaging story. Chilling.",5,1

868842,"Massive, Deep and Worth It","I was excited to discover this book, although its massive size at first made me curious.  How much stuff is packed in here?  I wondered.The excellent features of this book include the ""In Your Notebook"" sections where you can try out the techniques and strategies Mayes has just explained.  I also really enjoy the variety of poets  whose works are introduced.However, there are some moments where there is so much detail that I found myself losing interest and not retaining as much.  In that respect, it really showed Mayes background with a university-type audience.It is definitely worth it to have on any aspiring poet's shelf. I can see myself using this as a reference and as an inspiration for years to come.",4,1
2243633,Tedious,"I will say off the bat that I only read 1/3 of this book.  I thought the story sounded great--middle aged widow tries to find a new life for herself, but the author introduced so many characters and all their junk that it took away from the story.  I finally just skipped to the end to see if she ever found Cory and how it all turned out.  I kept hoping it would get better, but the whole think just gave me a headache with all the side stories on everyone else.",1,0

The two halves do match up very well, and the drive interface is a separate piece that is supposed to be sandwiched between them.

The cable ports are situated in such a way that they do not line up correctly with the holes in the enclosure, making it difficult or impossible to hook up your usb cable.",1,0
2113130,An interesting twist,"Truthfully I am no fans of vampire romance. I didn't even bother to read/watch the twilight series.But I decided to give this story a chance, since it has something about the bible. It started off slowly and got really interesting in the middle. The background story is somewhat believeable, a twist from the usual cain and abel storyline. After finishing the book, I feel like getting the second book to find out what is the next thing Alison will do. I will recommend this to those who like vampire story.",4,1
767161,Even if its a classic that doesn't make it good.,I had to read this book for summer reading and it was complete torture.  It was the first story in America to be done in venecular which made it a classic and hard to read.  some how his adventures are nothing but dull are semi-stupid.  Huck is not a perfect character and all his flaws seem to be over looked.  Jim is merely in the story because he needs to be and although he is not a brilliant person mark twain has not given the slave fair credit by making an unschooled boy half his age seem twice as smart.  His story also implied that southerns are stupid just by the way they talk amoung other things.  The story ends leaving you unsatisfied with what you that the main character should have learned.  Not worth the read unless you want to say that you've read it.,1,0

A drunk falls into the marsh and wakes up a century earlier. Lots of us would like to do that. I figured it was a spiritual journey of sorts.Sadly, the second part of the book was absolutely awful and was a total let-down. The guy is in an nuthouse and he does not improve. I did not care about him, his mentally-retarded child (I know that phrase is not politically correct, but it is proper if you actually know what the word means), his should-have-been ex-wife, or any of the other characters. Nobody is fleshed out in this absolutely incomprehensible book.There is one amazing positive about this book: The word FRUGALITY is an acronym for the way one should live life. It is marvelous and I will probably write it down somewhere. However, it does not raise the value of the rest of the poor story.",1,0

Magical Eden is kidnapped and the search for Eden is the main focus of the book.  I really enjoyed this.",5,1
8675929,Dietrich in a surprising role that revitalized her career,"Wonderful stuff from two unlikely leads. Jimmy Stewart plays Tom Destry, a deputy sheriff who is quiet and reserved, and doesn't believe in gunplay, even in this wild, wild western town of Bottleneck. Marlene Dietrich plays Frenchy, the barroom belle who's in cahoots with the town swindler until she is won over by Stewart. She dies in his arms at the end, taking a bullet meant for him.Dietrich's career was on the skids when she took this unlikely rough-around-the-edges role, and the success of the film made her a star again. When she sings ""See What the Boys in the Back Room Will Have,"" the answer is obvious - and has nothing to do with booze. Stewart is excellent as the unassuming, soft-smiling deputy - a man with ""personality"" who is always being reminded of a story he once heard or knew. The bit parts are played to the hilt, to great effect. The picture is excellently paced and great fun to watch.",5,1

9192546,Pretty close to perfect.,"As a kid, I loved the original series. I had all of the figures and VHS tapes of the show. So, we I first heard that they were remaking the series, I was super excited. For the most part, this is great, really top notch. But, my main issue is with the voice actors they chose for some of Skeletor's crew. They are HORRIBLE. Not only does Clawful, Beast Man, and Mer-Man sound goofy and dumb, they're just straight up obnoxious. It sounds so unbelievably kiddish, it's hard to listen to at times. If only they could redo the voices for those characters, it'd be perfect in my opinion. The action, storylines, and characters themselves are great. Orko gets a little annoying at times, but he's not in it much. And some dialogue is cheesy, but it's a cartoon, I'm not expecting Oscar worthy dialogue. But I am expecting the voices to match the style and edginess of it. Overall, it's great for fans of the original and new fans getting into them.",4,1

I have listened to this album all Spring and the thoughts and emotions that he convey thoughout the album are very soul searching. I love the positive and the negative on this album. I love the scenes that are set on this album and the songwriting.  Bruce bares his soul about relationships and it is such a heart wrenching record.  Favorite cut is Valentine's Day, my hair still raises every time I hear that Beautiful, Beautiful song. I like all the other songs on this album too except for Aint Got You. I usually skip it. Spare Parts makes me want to dance. Walk Like A Man talks about being a man(ready or not), Brilliant Disguise is just wonderful, Two Faces talks about different personalities we all have, Tougher Than the Rest talks about hearts being stomped on and becoming hard.

However, I'm getting into time lapse HDR movies now and focus stacking macro shots just because... I CAN now.  :-)Quality is very good.  There are rubber ""caps"" over the interface plugins which seem to me might fail after a lot of use but I'm not positive of that.  Definitely get a camera compatible promote systems shutter release cable also so you can use all of the features of this tool.

It's not a precise watch, the minute hand doesn't line up exactly, the bezel of course doesn't move so it's useless, and just for looks. I only buy solar watches, and with the digital calendar, alarms, and timer, its quite remarkable, because even the most expensive watches really don't provide any more information. But the workmanship is what you expect for this price watch. It's great for bumming around in. The band is also less than stellar, but functional.

His main message, be financially smart and pay attention to how you spend your money, is simply common sense and not a great revelation.  Beyond that, the book is vague and somewhat suspicious.  His tale of the rich dad makes one think that it is a fabrication.  Kiyosaki writes about the rich dad in such a formless manner that it seems plausible that the rich dad is purely imaginary.

4963089,Don't miss this one,"Why How Beauty Met the Beast and How Beauty Saved the Beast are Red Hot Reads: I'm fairly new to Steampunk-ish stories and although Jax's stories have that Steampunk feel, they're set in contemporary Austin, Texas. The hero, Wesley ""Hauk"" Haukon, is a scarred former soldier who embraces the Underlight society trying to find comfort and purpose. When he meets the heroine, Jolie Benoit, the life he's found is turned upside down. Through both of these stories Hauk and Jolie vow to be ""just friends,"" which sends the sexual tension off the charts. The underground Austin setting--literally in the steam tunnels under the University of Texas--is novel and fun. This series will continue with more stories and has become an auto-buy for me. And at a price point of $1.99 for the first story (clocking in at a little less than 40,000 words), How Beauty Met the Beast is a great deal!",5,1

3144209,Lean On Me . . . .*,"InHaatchi & Little B: The Inspiring True Story of One Boy and His Dog, author Wendy Holden wholeheartedly  describes the life of Owen Howkins, 9, and his dog Haatchi.  Owen has a rare genetic disorder and Haatchi was hit by a train.  Thus, they both have faced tremendous physical and psychological problems.  Together, though, they have conquered those problems one after another. There undoubtedly will be plenty more to conquer, but this book wisely shows it's best to live and love in the present, don't dwell on the past, and don't waste your days worrying about the future.  Moreover, life is much easier to navigate if you have a best friend to travel with you, especially one who shares your problems and gives you unconditional love.*Lean on Me (Single Version)",4,1

During her freshman year in high school, one of the other girls asks her if James and Link are a couple, and suddenly things begin to change: for Ellen, for Link, for James, for their families. Exploring the gray areas between gay and straight, ""My Heartbeat"" is an exceptional story aimed at a young adult audience, but certainly deserving a larger audience. Freymann-Weyr's writing is lush without being too flowery, sparse without telling too little. She tells us a lot through this tale, and ""My Heartbeat"" shines because of it.",4,1

I've always enjoyed reading Gaffney's books but this one is her best yet..full of quirky, yet endearing women, each faced with a unique challenge - illness, infertility, marital troubles,etc. Luckily, there is plenty of humor and charm as well.I don't want to give too much away here but female readers will definitely relate to the women here, root for them and be touched by their struggles. If you think the plot is going to be predictable, you might even be in for some surprises.  Yes, this is &quot;women's fiction&quot; but that doesn't mean it is fluffy or trivial. A delight!",5,1

I blush to admit that in my enthusiasm for the apparent subject, I had bought the whole series at once. What a mistake!

I read all the major JFK books ages ago (I'm currently plowing through Bugliosi's tome) and I wanted to see what a pseudo-newsman like O'Reilly could come up with. I went in with low expectations and was not disappointed. To be succinct, its pure crap. There is not a whit of independent research or new information. Its merely a compilation of superficial news reports that was probably thrown together over a long weekend to capitalize on O'Reilly's iconoclastic reputation from Fox news. The CD version has O'Reilly droning on as if he's reading from a phone book. I borrowed the book(CDs) from my local library so I couldn't send the discs Frisbee-style across the highway, but that is the only fate they deserve.This book is such a POS I suspect O'Reilly must be really desperate for cash to put his name on it. But then again, he works for Fox news.",1,0

7528902,Definitely not a gimmick.,"I have always washed my salad greens and shook them out in a dishcloth--this works fine but the salad spinner is definitely a convenience tool.  What I like about it--I can put a whole container of lettuce in the basket, rinse it, spin it, use what I need and store the rest in the fridge. Depending on the type of lettuce, it generally needs about 3 spins.  I empty the water left in the bowl after spinning, but I think leaving the water on the bottom might keep the salad crisper. I don't think it really makes a difference. It keeps for days and I just re-rinse and re-spin when I need more.  The lettuce is kept perfectly crisp and fresh.  There really isn't anything I dislike--it is big, but it fits on the bottom shelf of our fridge and it stores nicely in our pantry when not in use.  I thought it might be too big for 2 people, but it isn't.  I am sure the smaller one would work just as well and I may get that for herbs or veggies.  A very handy tool, and not a gimmick.",5,1

It required me to uninstall/re install the adapter at least once a day until I finally searched the www for a reason.  If you disable the N protocol in the device settings, it will work fine... but that sucks not having the N connection I often transfer large files over the wifi network).

And the author's attitude bothered me.  It was off-putting.It wasn't a really horrible book, which is why it got two stars, but I've read books that gave me a lot more help.

Catholic theology, tradition and liturgy are steeped in their Jewish heritage. I am a Christian priest, so I have a Mezuzah on my doorpost to remind me of that. Taylor Marshall has presented a simple but thorough examination of the major details of these roots. I would give the book five stars if he had paid more attention to the point that both Judaism and Catholicism are religions of Covenant.

I actually knew people like this when I was in high school.  The friends who stood by you know matter what, the friends who stopped being your friends because of the silliest (looking back it's silly - at the time, a significant ordeal) things.I particularly liked Noah.  The author did a really good job of getting into his head.(Slight spoiler): It makes you wonder about kids who use pot.  Some of them do it because they have nothing to do, but perhaps others do it to forget things that are too depressing to think about.The pacing was good, the conversations realistic.  I think Katie McGarry will go on to do wonderful things.  I hope we get to see more of Noah and Echo in future books.",5,1

This compilation covers his 30+ years very well, although Id personally include a few songs like &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;country comfort&quot;. Also, where is the border song? It was on the 70s hits album and I cant see why such a great song was ommitted here. Still,  nitpicking aside this album is enjoyable from beginnig to end.

Again, I hated finishing this  book, because reading her works make you feel as if you are right  there...the best friend of Barbara.

Once I started reading the story I could just really picture what Mr. Bonilla was explaining as he descibes things very well so well you'll find it hard to set the book down. I was very curious to find out what was going to happennext. It's a futuristic tale of a brutal civil war between the people of the USA and it's own government so you can just imagine what it would be like when the dust settles, how people continue to survive. I think it would make a great movie! Well done I enjoyed it.",4,1

These actually fit the bill quite well for me.  They fit comfortably in my ear and while I still don't like wearing them for long periods, they are very soft and non-irritating.  The sound quality is very good at any volume and I was pleasantly surprised with how well they block ambient noise.

This is more than just good music...Maxwell is doing something no other R&amp;B artist is doing...something really authentic and set apart, and I am really feeling him on this. There is something in his flavor that just speaks to me...takes me back to something inside of me that is long ago and far away...I get to peek at that thing again with Maxwell's music.  I don't know how he does it, but I think he understands that love is better hidden in the shadows a bit --- whispered and not necessarily shouted out...the kind of love that you can feel coming from miles away, but you just can't see it yet. This man is definitely at the top of my list of favorite artists, and I eagerly await what will come from his brilliance in the years to come. Five stars.",5,1

I was disappointed from the early pages, and my disappointment never wavered till the end, and I'm surprised at myself for even getting there. It's the first book in a long time that I couldn't wait to finish. Sorry, Fern, for being so critical, but I really was very disappointed. I agree with most other comments, it does feel like a draft. And so many parts don't make sense....",1,0
8454076,another terrifically original space opera/Sci-Fi fantasy from one of the genres hottest new writers,I do recommend reading 'Forging Zero' first if only to set you up with a greater understanding of the situation and the main character.

Light Up the Sky and Dead or Alive proved Van Halen could hit Deep Purple levels in hard driving rock, while Dance the Night Away varified they could write their own hits as popular as You Really Got Me.Ted Templeman had learned a little more about producing by this time too, and even though his simplistic mixes dominate this CD, the overall sound is a bit thicker.

Other than that, I'm not sure why Zebrowski, Dolph, et. al. were even in the book.  The plot was basically an excuse to go from one sex scene to another.

I could not put this book down...I even found myself sneaking to read it at work. I was capture by the characters and their relationships. The mystery and what ifs kept me turing the page.And the editing was amazing, which is pretty uncommon with self-published authors. But after checking out Amy Bartol's blog, I know why. She pays to have it professionally edited...she is truly dedicated to putting out a Fabulous piece of work. I am grateful for her efforts!!!I am just overwhelmed with how much I loved this book. I read a lot of books and do not typically take the time to post a review, but I was so moved by this story that I felt I had to.

It was written in 1979 and is a little bit dated -cell phones could have helped a whole lot, for example. It doesn't  matter though - Peters is always a good read, and this book is no exception.Peters' damsels are never in distress and D.J. is nothing if not resourceful. She manages to get herslf in trouble, naturally, but we wouldn't have it any other way.The book is funny, as many of her books are. A delightful Summer read!",5,1
7577909,Best trash can brand,"This is the second simplehuman trash can we've purchased, and it's the only brand we buy when we want great quality.  They're not cheap, but there's a reason for that.  The stainless steel doesn't collect fingerprints, and the lids seal tight enough to keep out smells.  We actually keep this in our twins' bedroom and unless the can is actually open, you can't smell anything at all.  Once the lid closes, the smell goes away.  (It's a more practical solution than buying a Diaper Genie that you'll never use once your kids are grown.)  I like the simplehuman trash bags, since they're really thick, but the white, 13 gallon Hefty ones fit just fine if you tuck some of it in the hole in the back.  The simplehuman trash bags don't work so much better that I feel the need to buy them instead.",5,1

9087074,Interesting Thriller from Argentina,This film is unique in its approach.  Who would ever expect an epileptic introverted taxidermist of participating in a huge heist?  The acting is solid and the film draws you in wondering what possesses the protagonist to get in way over his head criminally.  It also shows how southern Argentina has forests much like North America and Europe; not something you often see in films.  Good solid film.,4,1

1487277,A Big Let Down,I went into this book expecting great things. What I got instead was a train wreck of a book. The plot and character development lazily wander their way through the pages. This ended up with me never really caring that much about either.As for the ending of the book it was one of the worst ones I have read. The sense of disappointment and frustration as I read the last page was huge. After investing so much time in this book it felt like I was being forced to read the next book in the series just to get closure and some clarification of the first book.  I mean the author sent so much time building up to what promised to be an exciting conclusion only for it to end up people basically walking off into the setting sun.This is the first time I have read a Hugo award winning novel that did not deliver. Let&#8217;s hope it is the last one. I for one will not be finding out what happens next as I really don&#8217;t care.,2,0

9096012,9/11 in the making,"'The Hamburg Cell' is an excellent film that follows the 9/11 hijackers in the years leading up to the attacks. The film is simple, yet extremely compelling. The acting is superb, and the characters are portrayed not as frothing at the mouth lunatics, but as the rather ordinary-albeit demented-young men that they were. The film succeeds in showing how one can go from a shy, secular, college student, to an angry, brainwashed, religious zealot. From the several books that I have read on the subject, the film seems to be very accurate. Conspiracy theories notwithstanding, this is the true story of the 9/11 hijackers and how they came to be the most infamous men of our generation. I highly recommend this film.",5,1
5514747,Interesting Plot,"As a variation, this was not a typical rehash of the P&P plot but a reasonable change in circumstances that lead E and D to meet in a foreign country and encounter a few dangers.

7938776,Great quick read,"While the hashing out of past baggage intruded a bit into the developing romance between the two leads, overall this novella was fun, satisfying and sexy. In short order, the author manages to create two characters we care about and a relatively believable romantic/sexual relationship. Maybe it's a bit fanciful to think so much love could develop in such a short time, but this is fiction and the thing that makes it such great escape. Good enough that I ordered the follow-up book that tells the friend Luke's story. Recommended.",4,1

I did finish the book because I started it, but didn't really care who committed the crimes.  The last attorney I'd ever hire if I was in a legal jam is Leo as his main strategies for dealing with tough problems center around drug and alcohol use.  Also, he shows the most appalling judgment by putting himself in dangerous situations with no means of protection or escape.  Maybe he got stoned one too many times.

But this book really makes you think if that is what is most important.  The relationship between Lexi and Eric was so dysfunctional it was funny and I was rooting for Jon the whole time.  I'm glad Lexi ended up sticking it to all the jerks at her company in the end and only wish I could have seen their reaction after they found out what Lexi achieved.

6885642,The TP-LINK TL-WR741ND with DD-WRT performs better!,"I purchased the TL-WA5110G to replace an older failing wireless router that I used to connect to a wireless ISP. I also purchased a TP-LINK TL-WR741ND, and installed the latest version of DD-WRT on it. After spending an hour going back and forth between the two testing the performance, I found the WR741ND with DD-WRT performed significantly better by about 20%. With the TL-WA5110G, I would average around 4Mbps, and the WR741ND around 5Mbps consistently. Mind you nothing changed with the antenna configuration. All I did was swap back and forth the LAN cable and external antenna connection between the two when I was comparing. I don't know what would happen if I had the TL-WA5110G at both ends of the link, but contrary to the manufacturers claims, the TL-WA5110G receiver sensitivity is significantly less than that of the TL-WR741ND's.",2,0
833523,A great look at multicultural identity,"I loved this book! I enjoyed reading about the Jewish community in India as well as learning more about the Muslim, Indian, Pakistini cultures.Shepard's physical journey is one of rich backdrops and exotic Indian locales, all which Shepard paints beautifully. A particularly vivid scene of traveling by train in a world where cars are segregated by sex becomes a haunting look at what it means to be a stranger in a strange land. We ache for the mistakes Shepard makes as an American abroad.Still more exquisite is Shepard's other journey. It is one luxuriously mapped out inner voyage that asks her to question her identity and her place in the world. Her identity is itself another math problem. Before she discovers her Indian Jewish roots, she considers herself: ""Half Pakistani, half American. Half Muslim, half Christian. Half-half."" But just where does this ""half-half,"" as she calls it, belong?",5,1

6605258,You fix computers? Why don't you have this yet?!,This little device is the perfect solution for any computer tech or even a home user. If you know anything about computers and you need to get some data off of a hard drive this is the best thing. It's incredibly small and connects to the three major hard drive types. I had a client who needed their data off a dead laptop that was over 6 years old and used a weird SATA like plug called PATA. Since I only started working on laptops the last few years I thought all laptops used SATA drives. This device worked perfect.Pros- Small!- Runs old laptop and PC drives- Comes with power adapter- USB compatible with any system- Decent speed- Great for cloning- Uses 4 pin plug for power just like a PC power supply(I have not tried plugging it into power supply for power but I think it would work)Cons- Unfortunately the power adapter isn't small,5,1
7598696,Really works great on countertops.,"Used this oil on my Ikea butcher block kitchen countertops which are around 8 yrs old. Very impressed, absorbed well after about an hour and left nice shine and uniform look to wood , especially improved round sink where there're a few water marks. Works better than the ikea oil that's sold for the countertops and easier to use. Very pleased indeed.",5,1
8734021,For some old fashioned fun,"The acting is bad,the special effects laughable , but the feel of the movie is just like the original. I like the original slightly better, but this is a fun remake. You should know what you are getting, as this is NOT a modern CGI remake!",4,1
5081039,A great companion to a wonderful series,"This is the story of how the assassin Naji acquired his scarred appearance. It was nice to see this world from his perspective although we only saw one city. I'd like to see more about the Order.I liked seeing his blood magic from his own perspective, inside his head. It was also cool to see him slipping into the shadows.I give this short story a 4/5 and think you should definitely read it if you like the series. I wouldn't suggest reading this short story first though.",4,1
5361500,Review by KyBunnies,"For this reader this book ended up being one of those books that ended way too soon.  I quickly feel in love with Faith and Michael.Faith is the family black sheep.  She does what makes her happy and does not care what her family or anyone else thinks.She wants more than just a friend relationship with Father Michael but is quickly put off by her overachieving sister that is very jealous.To me this book is about never giving up.  Always go for your dreams, keep hoping and never allow family to stand in the way of your own happiness.  I see myself in this book.I will definitely read more by this author in the future.  Maybe a book that brings Maggie down a few pegs?Thanks for a wonderful reads.The bunnies and I give this book 4 carrots.",4,1
1253616,Old school goodness!,"This is the Stephen King you may remember of old.  The tone is reminiscent of the Shining and The Stand.  Yes, it is a long book, like so many of his works, but I haven't felt myself caring for so many of his characters in a long time.  Once again, King proves that his genius is being able to write the average person.  If you've been thinking about reading this novel, think no more...read!",5,1
3274253,SO PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!!!,"I have seen these books on the shelves and in the kindle store for years and skipped over them thinking that they would be too &#34;teen&#34; for me. I love YA books and all things vampire, but I am an adult and there is only so many high school mean girls I can take. When I saw they were making it into a movie, however, I finally decided to give it a try. I cannot say enough about how wrong I was, nor how much I LOVED it!!!First, let me say, it is SO refreshing to see a strong female character amongst the many shy, klutzy girls we've been seeing so much of lately! Second, the vampire story line itself was unique and interesting. Third, the relationship between Lissa and Rose was endearing, and finally, the forbidden love between Dimitri and Rose was perfectly frustrating enough to ensure I am going to finish the series!!This is a true testament to the statement &#34;Don't judge a book by it's cover!&#34;",5,1
8708207,False Advertising,"I actually bought this release as part of a boxed set of the original trilogy (now known as episodes 4-6), but I can't find that boxed set on Amazon so I'm writing the review for &#34;A New Hope&#34;, aka Star Wars.  I know this is old news now and there are at least a hundred other reviews here on Amazon complaining about this, but I was absolutely disgusted when I bought this set because the packaging claimed it included both the overblown, &#34;spiffed up&#34; versions of the movies and the original theatrical releases, and both were listed as being &#34;Widescreen&#34;.  I only wanted to watch the original version - I couldn't care less about Lucas' revamped version.  So I pop the DVD with the original version of the movie in my DVD player and get something on the screen that's letterboxed on all four sides and is such a tiny picture that I can't stand to watch in on my big screen TV.  Thanks a lot for the non-anamorphic version, George.",1,0
7436214,Great IPS monitor for the price,"For the price point it is a very good monitor. I use it for day to day computing as well as photo editing in Lightroom. It's got good color and decent resolution (for the size).The good:1. good color and brightness (especially after calibrating with a Spyder the colors are right on)2. very good black color (noticeably darker than my Viewsonic IPS monitor)3. sleek design (a modern look without clean lines)The bad:1. the resolution could be higher to make up for the larger size (my previous monitor was 22"" and also19201080 and I think it was about as big as a computer monitor should be for that resolution)2. screen is not antireflective (I actually like that as it makes the image sharperbut you have to watch out for reflections from other light sources)3. stand does not have wire guides so mouse/keyboard cables just hang around (I stilllike wired mouse/keyboard so I no longer have something to keep those wires tidy)",5,1

When I saw that this was on blu-ray I wasn't expecting the quality to be that much different than the DVD of it, boy was I wrong! When I watched it in blu-ray it was as if I had never seen it before due to the studio restoring its colors & clarity! The colors were beautiful and you can see how truly detailed their outfits and make up are. It makes you feel like you're in the movie back in 1955, the quality of the newly restored picture is unbelievable. For those of you who have never seen White Christmas, this movie has it all, singing (of course since its 2 stars are Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney), dancing & comedy by Danny Kay & Vera Ellen, and a bunch of beautiful stage performances all mixed in with the Christmas feeling. Its great for the ENTIRE family to watch together during the holidays, a true classic!",5,1
4615185,disappointed,The writing just isn't very good.  A lot of filler by repeating the same names and basically the same sentences  over and over again.  Had hoped for more.  Storyline is good but writing is not.  Certainly not the caliber of Donita K. Paul!,2,0

6026890,A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK,"Dramatizing a quintessentially literary ghost story for film is not easy, in fact, it is pretty well doomed to partial failure for those who have grown up with the Henry James masterpiece in print and in several movies that have based themselves upon it.This is quite successful in showing Brittan's music to good effect. I found it interesting, entertaining, well-sung well-acted, well-directed; however, I found it much too prosaic and realistic to evoke the air of mystery, of the unknown and unknowable, that an effective ghost story should possess.I have not seen any of the other versions available on DVD, but would guess that the average viewer cannot go wrong watching this if his objective is seeing  Benjamin Brittan's opera rather than Henry Jame'sstory.",4,1
3956989,Loved it!,"A novella in between Book 1 and 2, this was a great treat--finding out more about Issac and Stacy.  They are a mature couple w/ normal issues.  I love their family that are also featured.  A must-read for anyone who loves this series.",5,1
2791970,Going back to the future,"Having seen chemical fertilizer kill the soil and weaken plants, I had no trouble understanding the message in this book. We have implemented natural farming techniques in our tropical tree plantations in the Orinoco River basin of Colombia, and all I can say is that the results are exactly what this book suggests they should be - spectacular, with soil that is alive, full of micro-fauna, and with less cost to maintain, though a bit more labor intensive. If you are concerned about where chemical fertilizers and transgenic seeds are taking us, then this is the book that started the idea of going back in the future to what our ancestors already knew. I highly recommend this as an easy and interesting read for people who care about our planet and future generations.",5,1
9424138,"The Silent Hill Movies are stunning, gruesome, creepy and solid entertainment!","You need to see the previous Silent Hill Movies in order to follow this movie and too understand what's going on...it's not necessary, but it helps.  The acting is passable. Storyline is in the grey area, could be a little stronger but they manage to pull it off. The sound quality and cinematography are very good. The sets and props are all very good. The effects and CGI effects are top notch A-list level quality. Overall, this movie is impressive. There are no dry or dull areas in this movie its 0-60 from the start. The Silent Hill franchise is very impressive; the producers need to focus on quality script, and character development to industry A-list level. This franchise has a niche of its own similar to Resident evil, and they can probably produce another (3) sequels. These types of movies are special and rare, so I recommend you buy it on Blue Ray. Thanks",5,1
5193517,Not as good as expected,"I was attracted to the description of this book, but the book didn't live up to the description. I was hoping it would get better farther in the book. Unfortunately that didn't happen. The characters were dull. It was a very bland romance novel.",1,0

9122432,The Most Unique Comedy Around,"This is, unfortunately for me right now, one of those shows that you just need to see to understand. I recommend checking out some of their live stand-up/music routines on YouTube to get a taste of their humor.The show itself is  sort of a unique sitcom with comedic music videos mixed in to the story. For me, the funniest scenes are actually during the dialog scenes, and not so much the music (even though the music is hilarious). The writing is extremely clever, and the acting is even better. It's hard to sit through a scene with Jermaine, Bret and their manager Murray without laughing - the chemistry is perfect.I'm excited to see this coming out on DVD so soon and for so cheap. Flight of the Conchords made my summer, and this DVD is probably the best $20 you'll spend this year.",5,1

We got to find out more about his 'daddy issues' with Joseph, which strangely left me with mixed feelings as it  changed my opinion from book one. Then my emotions and interest in this story went full pelt when he saw Joss Daniels, prepare for a full on, attention grabbing and heart warming story that had me in happy tears at the end but many a oh my God tears during, trust me! Meeting the Vieri family had a odd effect on me, I found myself thanking them via my kindle for all that they had done.

That's pretty bad!",1,0
2976913,Great resource for parents,"As a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, I highly recommend this book. It is straightforward and instructive without being so technique-focused that you are afraid you won't get it right.It's my experience that parents are tired of freaking out and tired of being the homework police, but they get sucked into the role night after night. It doesn't have to be this way, and this book will help you find a way out--but you'll have to do your own homework!",5,1
4689781,Good solid zombie story,When I started reading this book I wasn't sure I would get into it. I felt it was clich&eacute; and was worried it wouldn't be well written. It took me a few chapters to hook in a different start enjoying it but by the end I was satisfied. It had a few new ideas for a zombie outbreak and was set in a location that allowed the story to be realistically contained.The writing is solid and the characters are managed well.If you are looking for an enjoyable zombie read I recommend it,4,1

The theme song is absolutely awful, but once you're past that you can find dependable entertainment. The series is smart and funny, and the stories are interesting. I find myself caring about the characters and wanting to know more about them. That's how I know I'm hooked on a series.

1970060,One Plus One by Jojo Moyes,"Jojo Moyes is two for two in my experience with her novels. I loved Me Before You and now I can add One Plus One to the &#8220;loved&#8221; category. Through the entire book I wanted to hug Jess, her stepson Nicky and daughter Tanzie and tell them &#8220;hang in there. It&#8217;ll be ok&#8221;.  I felt the same way for a few characters in Me Before You. Moyes never makes her characters pathetic or maudlin &#8211; just truly human. And while she does that she writes incredibly funny scenes as well as heartbreaking ones. The car trip to the Math Olympiad had me laughing out loud most of the time. Ultimately the point is made that everyone deserves a second chance &#8211; and to never give up. I turned the final page with a satisfied smile hoping that Jojo Moyes&#8217; next book won&#8217;t be too far away. I&#8217;m a fan. Highly recommended.*I received a review copy in exchange for my opinion*",5,1

The first part of the book was so hard to get through because it was so dull.  It did pick up a bit, but I still had to force my way through.  It wasn't scary, the characters were not interesting and the pacing was off.  It wasn't just that it took parts from other books, they were washed down.  Compare the kids in It to these.  Compare the aliens in Tommyknockers to these.  Compare the villain from Golden Years to these.  The book just doesn't hold up.  I only finished it so I could start Black House with a clear conscience.  I wasn't surprised at the end to find that his wife hadn't like the book, either.

The chapters lead naturally from concept to concept, and whilst I couldn't directly relate to all the concepts, there were chapters such as 'What Is The Ego', which really engaged me, and I'm now curious to find out more.

893280,"Smart, Heart in the Throat Reading!","We all think we know how we'll react in a fearful situation, but as Jeff Wise so brilliantly explains in this book, thinking has very little to do with our actions. Wise makes the science of fear fascinating, and he writes about it here in a gripping, fun and engaging way for all readers. I was drawn into the book by the compelling anecdotes the author relates, and enterprising information on the brain he provides. Now I'm even a little scared of how my mind works... But EXTREME FEAR is a thrilling read, and something anyone who's ever been in a frightening situation will be able to relate to.",5,1
2862877,Great guide,"This is the best travel guide I've seen anywhere. One could only wish they did these for destinations all over the world.

I set it up so that it would tell people that I was on vacation and would get back to them that evening when I returned to my hotel. The downside is that most people didn't know about the app, so they thought I was kidding and continued to try and text me. They caught on eventually, but I still came back to a ton of texts on my phone. It's also not 100% good at stopping texts. I'm not sure how some slip by, but they did.",4,1

Let me just say going from a 20 inch to a 27 inch is eye popping!!!!  It is absolutely gorgeous.  I love the speed, the screen is so clear and the colors just pop out at you.

And that is exactly what this book was - I didn't care about the characters, I didn't care about the story (or the changes therein) - all there was to care about was sex (and believe me, I do really care about sex).All in all, it was boring&#8230;I wish the author would have put her imagination into more than just the sex scenes.",2,0

The other reviews have recapped the story already - so instead of repeating them, I would like to say although Tom and Anne have a happily ever after and Tom keeps Drew's memories and body, what about poor Drew's soul. It seems like he was sacrificed to make Annie's wish come true.  It may have been his time to go - but it is kind of sad.I can't wait until the next book comes out in Nov. about Nathan Baxter - could the love interest possibly be Eloise? Hmmm.",5,1

So it just made sense to me to read Relic, since it was the next book in the series.  Boy was I not disappointed. The Brethen are angels sent to earth to help those of us that really need it.  It just so happens they really need us too.  Relic is more than a love story between Raphael and Serena.  It's about three souls bound by an ancient relic and a love that lives forever.  The ride they (Raphael and Serena) take together is phenomenal.Deena is a Indie writer that I consider my new must read author.",5,1

I loved going back to when you could buy a caddilac convertible for under 500bucks and a soda for five cents. What fun. I didn't love toward the end and he went back to the pretty bleak reality even though i knew he would probably go that direction somewhere in the book and seven though i knew it could be undone but otherwise, fun to get lost in the 60's and also learner a lot about the history of that time, even enjoyed the speculative conversations with Oswald etc.",5,1

1279900,Not Hard Hitting Sci-Fi but Entertaining,"In A Case of Conscience, James Blish lays out an interesting set of ideas however its quite obvious that his concerns are from a different time - a time of Cold War fears and nuclear terror.  However, the story he writes is a compelling one.  While these topics - what happens to an alien race when humans want their planet for something else, the desire for other sources of resources, man's incredibly strong penchant for killing themselves - have all been dealt with in countless science fiction books and television shows, Blish eloquently deals with these subjects using four unique characters and four unique points of view.  Possibly falling into the category of a modern parable, A Case of Conscience remains an interesting and provocative novel.It's a light book but fulfilling and a genuinely good read.",4,1
2273253,Everything you ever wanted to know about L. Ron Hubbard but were afraid to ask,"Having read many of the Scientology-damning books published in the last 20 years or so--Lawrence Wright, Jenna Miscavige Hill, Janet Reitman, Jon Atack, Mark Headley, John Sweeney and more--I can say unequivocally that Russell Miller's &#34;Bare-Faced Messiah&#34; is the Holy Grail when it comes to stripping away the myth of founder L. Ron Hubbard.If you are at all acquainted with Hubbard's story, many of the incidents related here will be familiar to you. But you will learn bizarre--sometimes touching--details that you've never read or heard before.In short, this is investigative journalism at its finest. Well-written, well-documented and packed with information, this biography tears the lid off the shiny stories about Hubbard's &#34;incredible&#34; life and achievements. They are incredible, all right, but not for the reasons Scientologists would have you believe.",5,1

So glad to see Heller develop into more... and for those of you not on Finder's twitter feed, you'll find it's very creative and fun with each new novel.

660305,Exciting fiction intertwined with events just prior to WWII,"Overall, an interesting and well written exploit based upon two fictional characters, one American and one British, both derived from the cold facts surrounding the Olympic Games of 1936 in Berlin. I found the book entertaining enough to keep me reading during a 4 hour airline flight. The characters are well fleshed out, believable, and you'll find yourself wondering whether the story is plausible as a reasonable explanation for several events that we all know took place. That, obviously, is not the author's intent, but it's a legitimate thought. You'll have to decide for yourself.",4,1
7614453,Toasty in my new house and 25 degrees outside with furnace pilot out,"My first review of any product.  I needed a space heater for my office since I work at home and did not want to crank up the furnace, so I ordered from Amazon based on previous reviews and am delighted.  Because I am in a new house unpacking and trying to work I just did not get around to having the furnace man come out and show me the ropes.  I don't even know where the furnace is located yet, and I tried to set the thermostat, hoping the pilot was lit, and it never came on. The forecast was for low of 32, but it actually got down to 25, and the thing kept me toasty, the office about 69 degrees.  Outstanding.  It made one creak on the maiden voyage and smelled slighty oily once.  I may order one for the living room, too.  I was used to the ""milkhouse"" style heater and but had burned my leg severely with one and wanted to try something new.  Highly recommended.",5,1
8959874,Annoying!,"Since so many people have written what this movie is about, so I won't go into it.  While I was watching this movie, I became very annoyed with that blond female.  It seems like only roll in this film and that Devil's Reject movie (I think it's the same girl) is for her to just shake her bottom.  She certainly cannot dance very well!  She really annoyed me, so I was hoping that somehow she'll be just gone from that movie later on, but that didn't happen.  Why can't Rob Zombie make a movie with decent actors and actresses who knows how to act?!  Why can't he make a movie that aren't always degrading women?!  If that blond is the one he is married to, then who  is that dark hair girl with the braid in his video?  Anyways, if you want to see a good horror film with good acting, well this isn't it!",1,0

8891122,Great movie.,"Yet another one of the few movies that I consider worthy of re-watching. Though this is my favourite genre (hell, I even liked Waterworld), this movie was very well done. It's extremely dark and forboding. The atmosphere is incredibly good. Sure, it's not entirely realistic (I can't think of a virus that would hit you in 10 seconds and turn you freaky so fast), but details like that aside I consider this to be a pretty accurate depiction of how a catastrophe like this could hit the world.Certain scenes are, of course, very memorable. Two in particular would be: 1) When what's-his-face wakes up and wanders around London, and nobody is around and 2) When what's-his-face et al. find a man and his daughter holed up, waiting everything out.Movies like this make one think ""Damn, that could be me one day."" Will it be you? Almost certainly not, but this is fiction with a real possibility to it, and that's what makes it so visceral and real.",5,1

6818356,Great Option For Those Who Hate Active Noise Cancelling,For the most part these are a slighty updated version of theBose QuietComfort 3 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphoneswithout the Active Noise Cancelling. They have a quality build as do all bose headphones and comfort is superior. The sound is what you would expect from Bose and have amazing sound and Noise Cancellation for Non-Active headphones. I did have an issue where a speaker was having a problem making a connection with the magnet but using my skills in electronic repair I fixed it myself. They work fine now. After 3 years of pretty heavy usage the leather on the outside of the memory foam headphones is beginning to peel off as I would expect after being exposed to oil from skin for long periods of time. They cost a nice chunk of change to replace but are not completely uncomfortable without the leather. I recommend if you want to own a Bose Product and don't want to dish out a weeks pay on it,5,1

He must have some connection to the CIA, with the clean up work he did at the house. Also, his 'welcome to the family' to Jade was a bit sinister.

Dealing with real issues facing teens, such as moving home and schools, parents with alcohol, employment and drug issues, and the sensitive issue of peer pressure, self harm and self esteem. These issues are blended into a very enjoyable fantastical story which shows Peake's fantasy talents off very well. This book is enthralling, very easy to read and relate to, and discusses issues without patronising the reader. Brilliant, another gem in Marilyn's crown. The cover is amazing and engaging too, and as always edited well. A treat to read for old and young alike.",5,1

There is no Mr. Tambourine Man on this box set for some reason and if it is due to licensing, fine -but you really have to start there. Harry Nilsson has no right to be here. The Youngbloods, yes. We Five - yes. Also - where - oh God where is the 1966 Jefferson Airplane?  Folk Rock (and yes, I was there folks) was 1965 to EARLY 1967 before psychedelia. After Disc 1, there was NO FOLK ROCK LEFT.  The influence was there to a degree, but that was it. It began January 1965 and was gone as of June 1967.

1421852,An Introduction to Modern Literature via Symbolism,"_Axel's Castle_ provides a wonderful introduction to modern literature and its sources in the Symbolist movement. However, the book is a bit uneven, and some writers garner more attention than others; Stein gets only about ten pages. It is clear that Wilson views Joyce and Proust as the two most significant modern writers, and those two chapters are accordingly the most insightful of the book and worth the price of the entire volume. In addition, the book will introduce most readers to the deservedly obscure Villiers de L'Isle Adam and may impel them to read _Axel_. Perhaps the latter volume will someday return to print now that Wilson's first work of literary criticism has finally done so. If you are at all interested in any of these authors or the Symbolist movement, this book is essential as Wilson is one of the foremost literary critics of the century, and this is perhaps his most representative and greatest work.",4,1

The opinions expressed in this review are my own.I started reading the wedding dress, and when I first began I wasn't all that entranced. To me it seemed like any other bride taking her time, not really looking to get married book. But as I read on, I was thoroughly enchanted by the story. I loved the history the book presented and the characters were so very real. I identified with each of them, and felt genuine emotion for each of the characters. I particularly LOVED Emily's story. I thought it to be so sweet, so loving, and I wanted more.This was an awesome book and I was so glad I chose it and wold recommend it to anyone for a read they just want to get lost in!

It was enough to go from being able to watch 40 local channels to only 28 but the more important ones (like channel 5, 7 and 11) worked fine until a storm hit. I'm thinking of buying an amplifier maybe that way the signal can go through at the same strength it did when I was using a shorter cable that had to dangle around loosely with people always running into it.I mean for the amount of cable you get the signal loss isn't even bad, but the fact that there was signal loss made me not give this a 5. I heard that you can get cables this long without any signal loss but they are extremely expensive so I just stuck to this and tried my luck!",4,1

4168018,Worth It!,"I'm glad I ignored the one negative review.  I could not put this book down.  The book seemed to address in a very realistic way, the roller coaster emotions that Rett and Tracey had to deal with as they fell in love.  The setting was in the deep south and delved into the very different backgrounds of Garrett, an all American middle class white law student and Tracey, a well to do African American grad student.  Somehow opposites attract but the two have to figure out a way to exist in the outside world.  The author developed the characters well, showed the evolution of the relationship and ultimately we got the happy ending that you expect from a romance novel.  This was my first book by this author, but I'll be looking for others.  Well done!",4,1

The book's plot is much the same, with the main characters visiting the kingdoms and meeting characters from  fairy tailes such as: Snow White, Cinderella, Jack 'n' the Beanstalk, etc.  There are slight differences between the book and movie in the plot, but  that, in my point of view, only makes it better.  The book also clears up a  few question left over from the movie, and gives you a better point of view  to understand why everything is happening.",4,1

949461,the truth hurts,I found this book very hard to read...the writing was superb. However the content was thought provoking and very racist. The book spelled out every detail about the racist practices of the french and other whites at that time. The book is a reference for history persons. I will refer to the book for its historical and racial content. I found it very hard to accept the attitudes of that time period because it is reminicent of the present day attitude towards africanss.,4,1

8893868,Best Comic Move EVER!,I thought the first Spider-Man movie was a thrill. This one was 100x better!!! I really thought the trailers would have spoiled the whole movie because they showed way too much but there are scenes they don't show that just blow you away! Dr. Octopus has always been my favorite Spidey villain and he's perfect here! Tobey Maguire really comes to life as Peter Parker in this film. I love the facial expressions he has when things aren't going well for Peter. The story leaves room for at least two more movies and the hints at upcoming villains are enough to ensure that the Spidey series will only get better and better!,5,1

5836631,Well....Okay!,"When I purchased this CD, I was not too impressed initially.  I expected that blaring R&amp;B sound that Mint has traditionally produced in the previous releases.  However, after listening to this CD a few times, it  really is an incredible piece.  Stokley's vocals are still crisp and clean,  it's just that he doesn't need to &quot;blare&quot; anymore.  Mint has  taken a different approach in Aquarium, they have demonstrated a true  ability to produce a nice R&amp;B GROOVE.  Be Like That Sometimes, Pretty  Lady (Charlie Wilson) are two cuts that I would love to have been in the  studio watching them record.  Their skills and talents as musicians still  shine through...it's just a little slower groove.",4,1

The alternative word is hypervigilant, and the application obviously, and it happened in this persons life a lot, is that they would make a great security guard and job / renter interviewer perhaps also. Of course, they are hard hard hard to get to know with all of that secrecy tendency which goes along with it, but they can with goodwill and luck become very good friends in some circumstances.

5779614,Alex Reece &#8206;- So Far,"Alex Reece, the vanguard of jazzstep (when such distinctions actually meant something), only released one major label album, SO FAR, but what an album it is. ""Feel the Sunshine,"" dives head first into the funky bassline, with Deborah Anderson's sultry vocals floating above, and ""Out of Time"" similarly emphasizes the thick double-bass. ""Acid Lab,"" on the other hand, puts more of a tech spin on things, and ""Pulp Friction,"" in particular, has a growling bass to accompany the horn flourishes, but it's certainly the darkest track here. But fear not: the R&B tinged ""Candles"" brings the mood back up with ease, and ""Ibiza"" brings the summer right into your home. But, for me, the best track is still ""Jazz Msater,"" a buoyant track that starts with a languorous horn fanfare before the good feeling kicks in full-time. The keyboard is exceptionally perky, and the whole thing is toe-tapping fun. It's a pity Alex Reece didn't go further.",5,1

Hopefully the author didn't use up all his ideas on this book and can develop better plot skills for future books.

I seem to be getting less overflow on heating so it suggests the power application is smoother than the 8 yo Panasonic we replaced. Door is fine, door opening switch is fine. All seems to be well.",4,1

8978912,Itinerant Kiwi,"I own quite a few yoga DVDs now, and this is my favourite. Partly because of the relaxed happy style in which it was produced, and partly because of the range of practices available. As one reviewer said, the vinyasas between poses are a bit fast for my liking, but you can always pause the DVD. The tragically/magically hips section is excellent; you will feel great afterwards. A range of people showing modifications helps. Nice garden scenery as a relaxing backdrop.If like me, you don't like too much navel gazing interfering with your yoga, this is just the right touch.",5,1

8620739,My favorite movie,"Back in the day when the cops were dirty, the women were dames, and the music was jazz; LA Confidential delivers a perfect portrayl of Los Angles during the early 1950s.  This is a brilliantly crafted crime drama based on James Ellroy's novel.  The characters and the places appear to be so real that you wonder if this really happened (it didn't).  Kim Basinger won the Oscar for her role as the ""high classed whore cut to look like Veronica Lake"".  Guy Pearce truly shines as an up and coming police detective.  Its amazing that this guy isn't a $20 mil/picture star.  With enough twists and turns to keep anyone enthralled, give this a look...in fact don't look, buy it.  You will watch it again and again.",5,1

I wanted to consolidate all I carry into one bag (and get rid of the purse and totebag I was carrying).  The pros:  It looks nice.  The color is pretty. It seems durable.  It is a good size. The cons: The zippers do not seem real sturdy, and I'm not sure they will last as long as the rest of the bag will.  I wish there were more pockets, dividers or compartments inside of the purse itself - everything is all in a jumble inside the bag.  The cell phone pocket is too small for my iPhone in its case.",4,1

6939569,"Simple Design, Fantastic Sound","After reading some of the previous reviews about the Creative D200 Wireless Bluetooth speaker, I was pretty skeptical.  Many of them indicated that the unit worked great the first day or so, but then simply stopped working.  So when I took mine to work and began using it at my desk, I waited for the inevitable failure of my speaker.  And I waited.  And I waited some more.  Yet still it persists!I'd held off on my review for that very reason, but now that I've gone a solid 2 weeks of consistent use, I can safely say that the Creative D200 is a great device.  It syncs effortlessly with my iPhone 4 and provides clear, deep sound.  While I'm not cranking it up to full volume at my desk, I did test it at relatively loud volume before I took it to work, and it sounded great then.  The high and lows are clear and efficient; while it isn't a Klipsch or Bose system, the sound quality is great for what I need.I really enjoy the system and wholeheartedly recommend it!",5,1

2207766,When I'm 164...,"Expanded from a short story published 17 years earlier, Methuselah's Children is about a subset of the human race (the Howard Families) who are exceptionally long-lived due to selective interbreeding. When the rest of humanity turns on them, mistakenly believing they are holding back some secret of longevity, they hijack a starship and go in search of a new home. This journey eventually leads them to a couple of planets with indigenous inhabitants that end up posing different sorts of threats that allow author Robert Heinlein to make a few points about liberty and the nature of Man.I enjoyed the story for the most part though the alien civilizations were rather underwhelming. Frankly, I'd rather have seen the Howard Families either duke it out with earth's administrators or find an uninhabited planet they have to colonize, which would generate conflicts and disagreements that would make interesting reading. Nevertheless, a fairly enjoyable read.",4,1
3627144,Held my interest from beginning to end.,"Mrs. Poe is exactly the reason why I enjoy historical fiction.  I learn about people and places and am entertained at the same time.  Does it bother me that I don't really know where fact stops and fiction begins?  Not really.I had no idea that Poe led such a tragic life.  I didn't know that he married his young cousin, that she was ill and died young, and that he was in love with a woman named Frances Osgood.This story immerses you into the life and style of the 1800's.  How concerned people were with scandals, while at the same time, doing scandalous things.  I can't help thinking about how similar the behavior is to today's behaviors, yet had these people lived now, how different the ending would have been.  Poe could easily divorce his wife and marry (or not) Frances Osgood.  He was a celebrity at the time, and we hardly even blink an eye at divorce and unrequited love affairs of celebrities.This book held my interest from beginning to end with even a bit of a mystery thrown in.  &#65279;",4,1

8587552,Good but Lacking,"If your looking for a realistic western than this is the best you can do. No epic bloodshed(as with spaghetti westerns)and no overly macho heroes(typical american westerns). This film is about and is based on a true story and its one of the only movies I know of that doesnt take its &quot;artistic license&quot; too far. This movie keeps its realistic edge while still managing to entertain. That being said, its also a sad movie that leaves you with an empty used feeling at the end. Watching a movie and feeling worse than you did when starting it is in my opinion the mark of a film that has too much of a downward slope. Anyways do not highly reccomend to anybody unless they want a realistic movie that will make you feel sad and used.",4,1

The original audio cable had big ferrite(?) filters at each end.With this new cable, I would have been able to reduce from 2 cables to 1 cable (since it has both video & audio in 1 cable).  But when I attached the new audio cable it has hum/noise that's very audible when I turn the monitor's speakers up past 70%.

My wife's only complaint is that the towels aren't big enough (i.e. bath sheet size), but if the usual hotel size towel is OK for you as it is for me, then the larger ones included is not a good buy, but an excellent buy.  5/5 stars easily earned with plenty of room, and that's not even considering the extremely reasonable price.

1508326,disappointing,"I was very excited to finally read this book but found myself very disppointed after the first chapter. I did like Conroy's descriptions of Charleston but his dialogue and characters were completely unbelievable.His main character appeared to have no faults. He always seemed to find the good in others, was at his friends beckon call and allowed others to insult him and generally be very mean to him including his own mother without any defense on his part.It seemed to me that everyone was constantly insulting everyone else and they all seemed to have come back lines which were just as insulting. And yet everyone was still friends and ready to run to San Francisco with no thoughts about jobs, kids responsibilities etc. I would also like to mention how stereotyped his characters were, the kind black people, the whorish actress, the snooty rich guy etc.The plot and characters were simply to hard to beleive and identify with.",1,0

3126599,another winner for Beth Ciotta,The Trouble With Love is the second book in the Cupcake Lovers series and just as good as the first! Another laugh out loud sexy read from Ms. Ciotta.

2390022,Helps to Put Things Into Perspective,"If you are living with a narcissist, you will recognize them in these pages. The case histories and descriptions are illustrative. At times the &#34;psychology-speak&#34; can be confusing to the lay person. Narcissits can leave you feeling crazy, confused, alone, depressed and afraid. The problem is you keep thinking there is something you can do about it which keeps you hanging in there, but it is all about them, not about what you give them, unless it is constant praise and affirmation in everything they do then over time, that may not work because they get bored with you. It is exhausting and depleting. I lived with one for 36 years and he left me to live with his new &#34;narcissistic supply&#34;. I could not understand why I could not get close to my husband but they play this &#34;come here, go away&#34; game that you cannot win. Buy the book for your sanity, take what you can from it then give it to someone else so they can be helped and then get help yourself.",4,1

9077931,Tiresome and pretentious - fn,"I had read The New Yorker's pan of this movie but I like Johnny Depp and the subject seemed interesting, so I checked out the DVD from Blockbuster. Fortunately, I have a monthly membership with BB and I had already checked out enough DVDs to break even, because I finally turned off this tiresome and pretentious piece of rubbish about 20 minutes from the end. I must confess that I had the English subtitles on and was often fast-forwarding at 2x through many scenes and simply reading what was being said. It was that bad. I could not decide if this movie was a parody of what we THINK  life was like back in those decadent, bawdy days or if it was a parody of bad movie. I am no puritan. It wasn't the  language or the sex. It was empty, boring, and silly. A waste of my time. AVOID!",1,0
2088172,One of the best books I ever read,"I've read a lot of books about the Templers.  This is probably the best book I ever read.  It takes you through the life of William who was a monk who became a Templar and his brother Richard, who also became a Templar.  It takes you on William's journey to find his uncle, John, and the peace that he found, it takes you on his conflict with his personal belief that killing is wrong, but as a Templar he must kill and it takes you on his journey to becoming the lead Templar knowing that many of his fellow Templar's would die.  It is so rich in historical detail that I couldn't put it down.  It's not like any other Templar book you've ever read.  I recommend this book so highly and I know that you'll enjoy it as much as I did.  If you are into the Templar lore please look into this book.  It was fantastic.",5,1
5243592,The Art of Submission,"You should definately give this series a read, Brie(After graduation) Its a great follow up to Brie learns the Art of Submission.

7441109,Wireless Shmireless,"This is my third ethernet over coax adapter. I love these things. They all work together (different brands/makes/etc).They are sooo much better than powerline networking. Faster and more reliable.I've had the other 2 running for a year or so with 0 reboots I think.Wireless is great for lugging your laptop around but if you have a stationary networked machine that you use for any heaving lifting (gaming.. home server.. NAS. HTPC/HD video streaming) and you can't easily get to it with Cat5/6 then this is BY FAR the way to go. I max out at about 11 or 12 MB/seconds with these adapters. As compared to 4 or so on wireless N.Literally, plug and play. Even the most technologically challenged people (minus my parents) could put this in.Keep in mind that this is only an adapter/extender.. You have to have 2 or more if you are starting from scratch.",5,1
1896560,The Real Deal,"This writer is capable of anything, as she proves after entering the lion's den with Hunter S. Thompson and coming out alive and intact and full of strange & savage stories. Thompson, an antic and important voice, can't be captured by a conventional biography; but E. Jean Carroll, a brilliant and skewed stylist, is creative and resourceful. She understands the artist, and the man, and slyly gets at the essence of both. Total fun! I dare Johnny Depp to option this!",5,1
6495973,"Spacious, well-padded & looks pro","Used it for Nikon D60. It is very well-padded and provides great protection to the expensive camera and lenses inside. The space inside is enough for a large pro camera, 2 lenses, flash, and accessories. there are plenty of pockets to keep charger, cables, cards, lens-cleaning pen, filters etc. One accessory pocket is covered under the flap and one is on the side, for faster access to change cards while shooting. The pictures posted here were very helpful for me to decide to go for this bag.The yellow color interiors makes it convenient to search for the stuff and provides good looks. In terms of size, as the name says, it is large and more suitable for pro DSLR. However, I also keep aSony DCR-DVD108 DVD Handycam Camcorder with 40x Optical Zoomand aOlympus C765 4MP Digital Camera with 10x Optical Zoomwith me while going out for photography. So the bag has ample space to keep all of the stuff and their accessories.",5,1
4362009,Great new author,"I just finished reading Betrayed by Lillian Duncan.  What a great read.  I fell in love with Suzanne, Conrad, Maria, and Layla within the first few chapters.  I totally put myself in Maria&#8217;s shoes from the get go and it was filled with so much suspense, drama, twists and turns, I didn&#8217;t want to put it down&#8230;so I didn&#8217;t until I finished.  Even when the book was finished, I didn&#8217;t want to say goodbye to people I had grown to love.  The underlying Christian themes of trust were powerful in a very subtle way.  Great read and I will be recommending it to many of my friends.I was given this book for free from BookClubNetwork and the publisher in exchange for my honest review.",5,1

4996610,Well Done,"Well done. The book is full of good advice for getting more writing done faster. The suggestions are practical, actionable and well laid out. There were a few typos, specifically areas where it seemed like the author changed the phrase and missed changing a word tense. I can overlook that her. The tone of this book comes across as the author giving advice. The informality of the book and the thought that this isn't a primary work for the author makes me more forgiving for some reason.",4,1
4647667,A Ture Keeper,"As soon as I received the package, I listened to the enclosed CD, dropped everything I had been doing and read the marvelous book from cover to cover. This is a short, but most powerful book and CD. I will recommend it to many people.",5,1
2047652,Not another dog story,"Although Odd Thomas is not my favorite Koontz character, as least it's not another of his dog novels, which probably lost the author many of his readers.  Still, it's one of the better Odd Thomas novels.  Probably deserves four stars on plot.  The other is for his coupling of reality with humor.  For example, the title character is trying to get away from pursuing monsters in a Chevy Volt when the battery dies.  I laughed out loud.  The politically correct will not like his references, but the common sense folks will guffaw.  Keep up the good work.",5,1

937248,"Great, but do I have to wait another 2 years?!","I really enjoyed this book. There are a lot of things that you finally learn about ""He Who Must Not Be Named"" - you know, he's named that because you can't really hope to spell it correctly without doing a google search. Finally we get a closer look into the man who became the menace. We also get to know Dumbledor better as well. More character development and maturation occurs here than in many of the other books. I really enjoyed it, and wish it hadn't stopped...I think that's really my only complaint - that I have to wait another 2 years to find out how this one really ends.",5,1
2570479,Low Carb but high flavor!,"This is a handy little paperback book that packs in a wealth of flavorful recipes. So far I have tried a few dozen recipes and none were disappointing-- even for my gourmet ""foody"" husband. It has lots of great ideas that reduce the carbs in creative ways. One of my favorites so far is using ribbons of peeled zucchini sauteed in garlic and oil instead of pasta-- love it!

5087462,TYPOS,There are so many typographical errors in this book.  I can't believe that it was released in this condition.  Many of the sentences were not complete.  I will not recommend this book. If I were the author I would be embarrassed to have this unprofessional work with my name on it.,1,0
2008258,Nice tie-in to the movie,"This book is a nice tie-in to the first movie based on The Hobbit. A few points I would note after going through the book:1. This book is mostly about the movie still images and not so much about the written content. The images themselves are very nice, but be aware of the size of the book (about 11"" X 9""). This is not a coffee table book, but the images are presented nicely for the size allotted.2. The content focuses on information about the characters and places of the movie. This is not a ""behind the scenes"", or ""making of"" kind of book.3. For me, the star of this whole package is the included fold-out map. It is done in the art style originated by J.R.R Tolkien, and continued throughout the Lord of the Rings movie.4. The enjoyment I got out of this was getting a peek of how the movies will be adapting the characters and places from the book. If you're anticipating the movie as much as I am, it's a great little printed preview.",4,1
686958,Beautiful Novel,"This is a lush novel that captures the reader's senses, and it is the senses that matter in this lovely read.  Although one's sense of smell is at the forefront of the story, all of one's senses are engaged.  The reader wonders how much of the story is actually true as it blends fact with fiction in a seamless manner.  One will never look at scent in the same way again....and, a woman will gain an absolute understanding of the importance of any perfume she chooses to wear.  Outstanding!",5,1
3636957,must read,Brynne and Ethan own my heart. This book brings you 'all in'....its very emotional. There's the amazing love story that we got in the first two books plus there's heartbreak and loss and uncertainty and fear! It's worth every single second......I'm not sure if there's going to be a 4th book but I certainly hope there is! Raine Miller is an amazing author and I can't wait to read anything else she writes! 5 stars are not nearly enough for this beautiful novel!!!,5,1
3448439,Sci-Fi Meets Detective Story - It's Good,"Sam Dane arrives at a planet to assist the local police in apprehending a serial killer, which won't be easy because an annual festival is taking place and damn near everyone is drunk and looks suspicious. Sam is also hindered by his inability to speak the language or read the faces of potential suspects. As the murders continue and Sam gets closer to the killer, will he get too close? A mixture if Sci-Fi and old fashioned detective work come together in a story that is an enjoyable read. In The Blood won't blow your socks off, but it will keep you engaged in the storyline and give you a front row seat to a different world from our own. In the Blood is a good book that I can recommend for anyone interested in the genre.",4,1

John Hampel has created a good crime drama about a bank that tries to take over the world. The characters are well crafted and plot twists abound. Like me, Hampel spent decades working in IT. He draws great portraits of the eccentrics and occasional sociopaths that field tends to attract.A good read.",5,1
4592697,Riveting Read!,"FIVE STARS for this excellent novel! The characters were multi-dimensional and complex; the plot mixed with fiction and history. I didn't want to put the book down. A must-read for those who love historical fiction, but highly recommended for everyone who enjoys reading well-written works.",5,1

1743112,Another MacKeltar!,"This fifth book in the Highlander series was another WAW for me.I already liked Dageus in the previous book so I was glad to see this book was a story about him.I loved the fact that we saw a bit more of Silvan, Nell, Drustan and Gwen in this book cause I really loved them in the previous book.Chloe, the slightly nerdy wee lass, was fab. She was everything Dageus needed to get him through his curse. Oh, and Dageus himself... what's not to like.Although I have to say, now that I read the books about both MacKeltar twins, I have a very slight preference for Drustan (and Gwenn!).",5,1
2345163,It gets better towards the end,"The writing feels clunky and amateurish for the first half of the book, but gains momentum and heart towards the end.  The revelations in the final chapters finally made it worth the effort of reading The Expected One, and prompted an interest to continue on with The Book of Love.",4,1
7655641,My new go to tool!,"Great masher and not just for potatoes.  Makes a speedy guacamole. Great for breaking up ground meat in the pan. I also use it for mashing bananas for banana bread. The longer I have it, the more uses I find for it!  Small but powerful. Does the job of the bigger guys! Easy to store since it doesn't take up much space.I've been using this several months now and love it even more! I find I am using it far more frequently than I thought. It mashes so effortlessly.  I tested it by mashing an avocado with a fork and then with this tool. The tool did the job in a fraction of the time:)",5,1

8949560,Femme-fatale Famke...,"...was the reason I rented this, &amp; in that leather outfit she looks almost like her Jean Grey character in the X-men movies (the character in which I know her best). This movie also was my introduction to Owen Wilson, &amp; I love that scene in which he seduces Famke by singing a song by Marvin Gaye (one of my favorite singers!), with Eddie Murphy tele-coaching him. I also enjoyed the DVD commentary, in which the director &amp; a few other people comment on how this movie parodizes the Bond films by &quot;humanizing&quot; the protagonists, writing mistakes into their behavior. A few times here &amp; there, they even stumble over pronouncing the Dutch beauty's name--&quot;Fam-keh?&quot; No! &quot;Fahm-kee?&quot; No! &quot;Fahm-keh?&quot; Right on target! (No pun intended) Anyway, if there's one reason anyone oughta see this, she is it!",4,1

Given the price and quality, I would definitely recommend it. Happy shopping!",5,1
5506,Best Money Manager App for Android,"I've been using this app for over a year now and think it's still be best money manager on Android. Devs do a great job of listening to users and adding/fixing features. Ten dollars is the most I've ever paid for an app but I consider it money well spent.Edit: I see this is the FAOTD today. Guess that means all the crazies are gonna come out to trash the rating for any number of reasons that have nothing to do with the actual app. It's a shame, really, since this is a terrific app that does what it says and does it well. I'm still using it a year and a half later... not many other apps I can say that about, if any!",5,1

6701532,Probably the best value for any processor at this point in time...,"I spent several days researching the differences between all the current Intel processors before finally deciding on this one.  The problem is that most of them are very close in price so it's difficult to make a decision on price alone.  I found that when you consider all the factors like number of cores, mhz, cache and price, this is the best option.  It is fast enough for the most demanding multimedia and games and has all the energy saving features so you won't waste energy while doing something like typing word documents.  If you are building strictly for gaming then you should probably spend the extra $30 on the Q9550 even though this one will do quite well if paired with a high end graphics card.  On the other hand, if you are building as a office type computer for email and word processing etc, you should probably save the $20 and go with the E8400.  This one is the perfect middle ground for great performance at a great price!",5,1

8643094,A truly epic battle...,"A very powerful film, realistic and gritty, it tells the story of Operation Market Garden when the Allied forces try to knock the Third Reich out of the war with one blow.  The idea is simple - grab a bunch of bridges in Holland, using airborne units, which would then be linked up by a massive ground assult.  The result would be a pathway right into the heartland of Germany, straight into their factories and workshops.  The real result was more casualties for the Allies than suffered during the D-Day invasion.It is a great movie, full of drama, humor, and movie stars.  Gene Hackman, James Caan, Sean Connery, Robert Redford, and Michael Caine to name a few.  It was based on the book, A Bridge Too Far, but I am not sure how authentic it is to the facts.  But it is a must see, right up there with such films asTora! Tora! Tora! (Two-Disc Collector's Edition),Patton (Two-Disc Collector's Edition), andThe Longest Day (Two-Disc Collector's Edition).",5,1

8796069,THE BEST high school movie!,"This is the best high school movie that I have ever seen! I started having all of these memories of when I was in high school as I was watching this  movie. So much of the stuff that happened in this movie has happened to me  throughout my high school years. It is the first realistic high school  comedy that I have ever seen, and I recommend it to anyone. For an R rated  movie, it really wasn't that bad. There were a few &quot;F words&quot; and  some very mild sex talk, but that was it. It could have easily got a PG-13  rating if it had had some trimmings here and there. Anyways, great movie!  Rent it! I know that I will BUY it!",5,1

Mary Roach does visit them and this makes for fascinating reading.  Certainly good enough for me to buy her other works.From nose to anus this is a great read.

It can be hard sometimes to conceptualize what's going on inside of you when you're pregnant, and this book made everything seem so real.  It was wonderful to have a little update to read on the baby's progress day-to-day.  My husband and I read it together each night before bed- as a father-to-be, it helped him feel involved, and helped him form a bond with our baby.  It also provided us with lots of great opportunity for discussion of the facts, the myths, and the fears of the whole amazing process.  I give this as a gift to every pregnant woman I know!",5,1

2438230,A Great Sequel,"Finding our place and following our hearts is the moving theme of Dare to Dream, a finely-tuned finish to Heidi Thomas's trilogy inspired by the life of her grandmother, an early rodeo-rider. With crisp dialogue and singular scenes we're not only invited into the middle of a western experience of rough stock, riders and generations of ranch tradition, but we're deftly taken into a family drama. This family story takes place beginning in 1941 but it could be happening to families anywhere - and is. Nettie, Jake and Neil struggle to find their place and discover what we all must: life is filled with sorrow and joy: faith, family and friends see us through and give meaning to it all. Nettie,  or as Jake calls her, &#34;Little Gal&#34; will stay in your heart and make you want to re-read the first books just to keep her close. A very satisfying read.&#8212;Jane Kirkpatrick, a New York Times Bestselling author and WILLA Literary Award winner of A Flickering Light",5,1

2191249,Stephen King - Integrity Personified,"When folks write about personal issues or situations, there lurks a reluctance to reveal truth.  Stephen King shares, with unadulterated honesty, those whom he loves with his reader.  Every man should have a similar mother who encourages him, and a similar wife who loves him with the same lusty, faithful exuberance.  After the stark honesty about his life, Mr. King then exposes secrets (yes, secrets) about being a writer.  He surprises you as he reveals the obvious (only you do not see the obvious until he reveals it) regarding various aspects of writing, particularly fiction, but his revelations fit any genre.  Thus the secrets become simple common sense.  After reading ""On  Writing: 10th Anniversary Edition: A Memoir of the Craft"", if you are not inspired by Stephen King's life, or if you do not become a better writer, the fault lies within you.",5,1

5573254,"Complex, fast-paced and totally satisfying","K. T. Roberts has a real talent for setting a scene and writing crisp, believable dialogue. I was immediately pulled into the story. Reading Deadly Obsessions, I felt like I was riding along with Detectives Jesse Kensington and Zach Gerard - easvesdropping on their conversations, worrying about their safety as they hunt down a serial killer, and rooting for them to work out the kinks in their personal lives. They were that real to me. The plot is complex and the pace is fast, but the writing is so clear that the reader never looses track of the story.This is a great read as a thriller, but it is much more than that. As the story unfolds, we watch the characters grow and learn to deal with their personal demons. In short, it satisfies both as a crime drama and a love story. I hope to read more Gerard-Kensington Detective stories. These characters are deftly drawn - vulnerable, likable and, most important, completely real.",5,1

I could not put this book down until I finished it.  I enjoyed the narrative point of view from each of the characters.

This romp to planet Altair, besieged by an unknown evil force, is unbelievably hilarious for its pulp and sixties sensibility. The movie always threatens to morph into a weird episode of some sixties sitcom with a name like ""Leave it to Beaver"" in outer space.

970020,Amazing book... with lots of insight... but one HUGE problem.,"...And the problem is that not everybody is a great storyteller.This book shows how we can use the power of narration in order to sell anything... from ideas, products, concepts... and even ourselves... to ourselves. And also it shows the importance of storytelling in our lives - in the sense that it influences and touches us everywhere we are.But not all of us are born storytellers. And of those who will learn it, not all will look like natural ones.So while this book is brilliant in showing how important our narrative powers are (or can be if we really work them), is also shows the importance of our commitment and our understanding of such value. Important? YES. True? YES. Valuable? YES. Easy? No.I loved the book and it did a lot for me.Recommended.",5,1

1454577,Choking and Intoxicating,"Wildwood Dancing is one of those books that wraps you up in a fog and doesn't let go until you've finished. You choke on the story, that's how thick and rich it is. I loved the descriptions, the love, the setting, the plot, everything. I am not usually that oblivious but I was thrown for a loop when the true Gogu was revealed, don't worry, no spoilers. After I finished this book every other book I picked up was terrible and awful and all I could think was, ""it's not Wildwood Dancing!"" I have since read it several more times and each time I'm once again wrapped up in that lush, imaginative fog where things aren't as they seem and a poor farmgirl can be a princess for a night.The cover art is also amazing. it's what originally drew me to the book.

Since I'm just starting to explore the book, I can't give a very in-depth review as yet, but it has certainly captured my interest, as well as being a real exercise for my brain.  I have no interest in visiting the country, so I don't need to know how to find a restaurant or bus stop, etc.; but, I would love to be able to understand what is being said in the K-dramas, rather than depending upon sub-titles.  Hopefully, in a couple years, that may happen, with the help of this book.",5,1

A story of love, healing, courage and faith transpires from the very first word to the very end.

Hugh Grant's comic timing took me by surprise, as did Jeanne T's convincing rendition of a mafia don's daughter. James Caan was actually the reason I picked this DVD up and did not regret it. Very worthy spin for an evening if you like atypical comedies in general or mafia comedies in particular.",4,1

This book opens a pathway to a life without diets, guilt about eating and controlling what you eat.The methods and processes are presented embedded in the story. Becoming present is something at least I struggle with and sometimes even abhor because of the emptiness that often follows. It's also one reason I eat after I'm no longer hungry :) Geneens book and everyday meals provide a wonderful framework for becoming present, actually tasting what I eat and dealing with all the emotions/states of mind that follow. I cried and laughed while I read this book.I would recommend Geneen's work to anyone who wants to live their life intensely and authentically, to anyone struggling with weight issues and ready to do anything to change, to anyone ready to face themselves.",5,1

The author explores how to seek out quality works of fiction, non-fiction, and poetry in helping the reader develop a sense of good literary taste.  The book also explains how literature has changed from the Middle Ages to the present, but in an entertaining way.

He covers all the basis with style, spark and creativity.  I found his style to be very modern (but, not too modern. I.E. silver, and black lacquer) hip and full of spaces that everyone would LOVE.  His work is simple but, still very impressive.  I really think that the &quot;average&quot; person could re-create many of the elements that Lowell introduces.

776940,lovely coming of age story,"I bought this book years ago after reading and falling in love with High Fidelity.  I'm slightly disappointed because About a Boy didn't quite match up to H.F.  I found the beginning a little slow, possibly because I was distracted by not immediately falling in love with the novel.  Through the middle, the story develops a real heart and you begin to fall for the characters of Will and Marcus.  The end is wonderful, not quite the ""happily ever after,"" but this is to be expected.  But you're left with hope for Marcus, and for Will when you finally shut the book and sigh happily that everything worked out alright.",4,1

Every responsible citizen should know these things, and this book explains them wonderfully. I am going to teach everyone in my family some of the things I learned in this book. The part on handling common natural disasters is excellent and full of detailed information. Overall, this book is very well written with plentiful details on all the aspects of survival and preparing for contingencies richly explained.Get this book, your life may depend on it.",5,1

The audiences loved them but the academics, politicians, party leaders and censors barely tolerated them and tried to force them to serve the grim worker mentality of the state.  On the one hand, these musicals are oddly entertaining. On the other, they are a grim reminder of how human happiness and the human spirit is so often strangled by political and religious repressive systems.  People want to laugh, love, and, yes, sing and dance.  Too bad that that is so threatening to so many. This is an interesting documentary that was well worth watching.",4,1

There are several typos in the Kindle version, but I can easily move beyond them without disrupting the flow.  As an avid sports fan, the book is clearly engaging and heartwarming.  It describes the importance of the team concept and overcoming odds.

1271922,Good - very basic - instruction,"I used to teach both at a private school here in Pensacola, and at the same time - I was teaching a class, once a week, at a local high school.I had the {private} school purchase about 30 - 40 copies, I used to give them out when the kids had trouble or requested help in that area. Children in the age bracket 8-12 who were just beginning to learn chess found it very helpful.If you are basically just a beginner, you have played less than 100 games of chess, and/or you feel your tactics are really bad, then I would highly suggest this book to you. (Then for further study, I recommend Kopec's &quot;Practical Middlegame Tecniques,&quot; followed by Reinfeld's &quot;The Complete Chess Player.&quot;)",4,1

5812058,The Arrival of a Renaissance Man,"Kenny Lattimore's self-titled debut, was a celebrated affair, but, was not actually his first album. He had recorded an album, &#34;Manniquin&#34; for Epic that was shelved for some god-forsaken reason. But it was his sophomore release, &#34;The Soul of A Man&#34;, that solidified the arrival of his immense talent for me. With a voice blessed with grace, soul and dignity, Kenny Lattimore somehow has yet to receive his due.Opening with the dazzling first single, &#34;Days Like This&#34;, Kenny delivers a confident, exciting performance wrapped in a swirl of electronic keyboards is easily one of the best singles of the year.",5,1

Three things struck me particularly as I read: (1) The remarkable apparent exodus of humans from Africa by way of a string of islands in the southern Red Sea and their spread throughout the rest of the world; (2) The thousands of years humans and Neanderthal struggled with one another in Europe and central Eurasia; (3) The horrific nature of primitive warfare.

7011333,remove the metal plate and then works well,"i got this today. I had read the reviews about the metal plate in the device. I decided to leave it in and test it out first. Fresh out the box, I could get a range of maybe 15 feet before the music started skipping. I then opened the device with a screwdriver (see other reviews on how to do this), removed the metal plate and put the device back together and taped it with black electricians tape. Now the device gives me the 30ft range without any issues.I'm streaming music to the belkin from an ipad 3. The music is 256kbps MP3 files. The belkin itself is connected to a Bose sounddock. So far in over 4 hours of playback I haven't had any issue with the quality of the sound.Given the price of the product, this is an awesome device. Once the metal plate is removed, it works nicely.[edit - one year later] Paired this with an iphone 5s. Still works well.",4,1
538857,"An earnest, good book","I read this book three years ago, when I was in fifth grade.  It seemed to be the world's best book then.  Now a little wiser and wider in my knowledge of literature, I see this book as an earnest, honorable book.  One thing I loved about this book was how the perspective of the book grew  more mature as Francie grew up.  It makes this book a 'happening book', and  draws its readers well into the book while reading.  Another excellent  technique that Smith used in the book is the way she made littel events  seem so important and glorious, the way it would seem to a little girl.  It  is a touching, rich book, full of emotion and feelings.",4,1

The fact that it handles IDE -- I still have a couple around -- was gravy. The Sabrent wouldn't get a SATA connection with the Blue so I left the old drive in the laptop and hooked the new HD up instead. The copy process would work for a while, getting slower and slower, and then fail due to an error on the new drive. Came in several mornings hoping for the best and ... nada. Spoke to Sabrent tech support  a couple of times, tried their suggestions, and then returned it at their request. At least Amazon makes that part easy.I ended up buying  a Cavalry duplicator from Meritline for $45. Not to make this a review of another product, but the Cavalry did its thing in less than two hours with one button press.",2,0
4396135,A Master Shows Us His Funny Side,"If you've ever watched the Frazetta: Painting With Fire DVD, he talks about this stuff. Frazetta loved doing funny stuff, and his artwork is a treasure to behold in these classic stories. I can see why Disney kept on trying to get him - his comics were rivaling whatever Disney's artists were doing in comics form (Walt Kelly, Gottfriedson, and the great Carl Barks were probably looking over their shoulders at what Frank was doing all the time). These are great to read to your kids (buy two - one for the parent, the other for the child), and enjoy a more relaxed and entertaining Frazetta; plus all that beautiful artwork!",5,1
1852099,Great premise - Poor execution,"This book sounded perfect for me! I love adventure books filled with history and science (Cussler, Rollins, Crichton) and I teach about Aztec and Maya history. Unfortunately, this book did not even approach my expectations. The author provided paragraphs and pages of description of location, people's backgrounds, appearances, etc. which did not have bearing on the plot, did not drive the story forward, and did not provide insights into motivations of characters. In addition, the many characters began to overlap in my mind and it was difficult to differentiate who was doing what. Sub-plots aboud but do little to create a cohesive story. The ending was a let-down and the ""action"" sequences were more description of events than guiding the reader ""into"" the story. I finished the book because I hate abandoning stories but by the final fourth of the book, I was skimming over narrative to find dialogue and action that had bearing on the plot. I was extremely disappointed.",2,0
1819871,God love the English,I have a penchant for British novels dealing with that English eccentricity that is both hilarious and moving. This book delivers everything I love about English writers. You love the outrageousness and the belief in something more in life than what you've lived and never ending hope and true love that seems buried and cold after 20 or 30 years. How quickly we all forget these things and how wonderfully they are found here. It's not at all predictable or cliche and will surprise you along the way. Just an excellent and satisfying read. I couldn't ask for more.,5,1
4303975,A great conclusion to this series,"I will comment on the whole Surrender to Destiny trilogy as well as this book itself. Each story is unique and yet they flow together so well. The detail that Mrs. Tyndall puts in her books is amazing. The ships, the clothing, the manner of speech, it's all there. The characters are real, not stereotypes, and each of them are unique. Their struggles ring true to us even 200 years later. I can sympathize with the characters and be frustrated by them at the same time because I see myself in them. The message of God having a plan for His people plays out in a very real way throughout the series. In Surrender the Dawn we meet two people from different backgrounds who share a distrust of God and other people. They are different, but a lot alike in that they want to make their own way in the world and provide for their families. Circumstances force them to trust each other and eventually to trust God.",5,1

Configuring the extra buttons is easy too.Convenience - I love the ""search"" button located below the scroll wheel.  Click it and it opens up a new tab in your browser to your preferred search engine.Better browsing experience - I love the backward and forward buttons built into the side of the mouse.Battery life - It's giving me 10 days of battery life at a time.

4641461,Entertaining and inaccurate,"A good book for casual crime readers who don't need heavy details, but amazingly inaccurate in several areas. Seems to repeat old myths told in other books rather than do research.ie Joe the Boss's hit team did not include Anastasia, Adonis or even SiegelorDutch Schultz was not shot in the bathroom or even shot by Charlie Workman. The caliber of the bullet found in Dutch matched those used by his men, not those who had shot his men down.

9053717,A Noticeable Difference but still Good Batman Entertainment,"There is a noticeable difference between this Volume and the previous 3. This set, as the description says, is from The New Batman Adventures. The animation is different, some of the voices are different (only a few), and the characters are slightly different. For example, in the first three Bruce Wayne and Batman have different voices both voiced by Kevin Conroy while in this volume Batman and Bruce have the same voice voiced by the same voice actor. I also think this set tries to make Batman look more human and less invincible. It focuses more on the story as a whole and Robin, Nightwing, and Batgirl rather than how the events affect Bruce/Batman. Altogether, I like this set almost as much as the first three volumes. It is still good Batman entertainment and I'm almost disappointed that I've almost watched all of the episodes in all four volumes.",4,1

1929923,A Worthwhile Look into the Nordstrom Culture,"The Nordstrom Way was not developed overnight.  It has been four generations and over one hundred years in the making.  It is a culture, not an act that can be turned on and off.  It is a pleasure also to have its recent top salesman Patrick McCarthy share his story.The Nordstrom Way oozes with pride... the pride of providing a top-rate retail experience.  Salesmen are empowered to make decisions.  This is not just lip service.  They carry a card which states ""Rule #1: Use your good judgement in all situations.  There will be no additional rules.""  Emphasis is given to placing the needs of the customer ahead of short-term profits.Other aspects of this 'culture' include promoting only from within and profit-sharing.Most retail outlets have a small Customer Service department.  At Nordstrom, the whole store is the Customer service department.The Nordstrom Way embodies simple concepts that are not necessarily easy for other companies to duplicate.Five Stars",5,1

But, it is sufficient to say that both photography and music/narration are excellent. 60-minute video covers quite a bit of materials, and showcases beauty of the three islands. The aerial view footages are great. Just want to mention that this blu-ray has no subtitle, but has scene menu as well as audio setup, in case you are curious. The video is actually widescreen (1.78:1).",5,1

Not all of the findings match up with my personal political philosophy, and I imagine the same can be said for any other registered voter.

1497798,One of Balogh's best,"This book, which is the 6th and last of the Slightly series, is my favorite. It has delightful touches of humor and comes close to slapstick in certain scenes. The hero, Wulfric, is a duke of icy demeanor and rigidly correct behavior. He has no tolerance for fools and distances himself from almost everyone, including his many headstrong siblings. But behind the barricades he has erected lies a man yearning to be loved and understood, wanting to reach out but not knowing how. Enter our heroine, an impoverished widow who, despite a tragedy in her past, has a warm, outgoing nature that makes her a universal favorite. She embraces life, and once Wulfric is drawn in to her orbit - or she is drawn into his - there is no escape for either of them. This hero and heroine are a perfect match and this is a perfect read for a sunny summer day.",5,1

Jules is a likeable character with a haunting past she wants to leave in the past, but her secrets are about to come out into the open. Her emotions felt very real to me, and I found myself holding my breath for her. I love Jules's interactions with her sisters. Their relationships were wonderfully complex and endearing. The exotic setting of Durban, South Africa adds an exotic flavor to the read. And the touch of sweet romance budding anew left this tense and emotional read on a high note.

And, while the wrongdoings of the past cannot be undone I believe it's important to understand them and how such things happened, to understand the contributions of Native Americans to  our culture and how they served this nation that did not always serve them.",5,1
4012294,WOW,"Molly's story in Sweet Home was beautiful. Rome's story...gut wrenching. Its bad enough that I often get teased for laughing out loud while reading, I am so glad I was reading Sweet Rome at 3am because there were TEARS! I was so glad to get to see more of Rome and Molly's life, and to be honest, seeing things from Rome's POV actually made me re-read Sweet Home. Ms Cole nailed the male POV, and Rome couldn't have been more perfect in all of his imperfection.",5,1

Very looking forward to read and to learn more from Colonel Brazee's books.",5,1
786325,SLO,"Best book I've ever read.  Not easy reading, but prophetic.  It's a MUST for anyone in this day and age of politics where Obama is seen as a socialist (he's not) and the real socialism in France, England, Canada, Germany is being challenged, but not as Ayn Rand challenged it.  It's being challenged by the benefactors of socialism for their respective Government cutting their socialist benefits!  Amazing.",5,1

9337795,too fine,"I could watch Idris Elba all day long everyday.  What a fine tall drink of water!  I love his acting, his character is so on the edge, he puts himself in harms way time after time again.  this show is very suspenseful, reminds me of a cross between Scandal and Criminal Minds, but with better acting.  You never know what you will get with this show...who will die, what type of killer they will deal with, etc. I wish season 3 was free for Prime members, since Amazon has jacked up the annual price.  But that's the only gripe I have, and not the show's fault.  Excellent murder/suspense series!",5,1
1909252,Pointless superficial rumbling,"The book is full of superficial disconnected anecdotes. The authors provide no deep insights, no real explanation of core technological principles, no science front-line update, and no key questions to be answered. Paragraphs are disconnected from one another, with no substantial development of ideas and knowledge. At some point I started skipping 5 pages at a time looking for interesting material. It actually did not disturb the reading, since there is no build-up from one chapter to the next, or even not from one page to the next. The writing style is also poor - here is an example from page 206 (simply where I am now at the book): ""Negative aspects of chemistry include pollution, drug abuse, and the problems posed by semiconductors, computer viruses, identity theft, privacy invasion, cyberwar, and bioterror."" - what's the point of these ""negative aspects of chemistry"" in book about genetic engineering? Bottom line, one of the worst popular science books that I ever read.",1,0

3414068,Implausible,"From the beginning I found it hard to relate to the characters: The protagonist, Amanda James, is this super-woman: more intelligent, better looking and more athletic than anybody you meet in real life. Same for her ex-boyfriend. While I didn't care much for the characters, something about the writing style was intriguing and kept me curious. So I read on. The story of Cain is actually interesting and entertaining to read and history comes alive. But about a quarter way through the book, &uuml;ber-smart Samantha cracks the secret code to the vault door and goes inside without telling anybody else the code. How stupid can you be?! And the next thing is so obvious: The door slams locked and she is trapped. Oh, and she doesn't even panic. I had to stop reading.",2,0
8901183,George just knows how to make zombie films.,"Some people hated this film.  Not sure why.  Perhaps they think George Romero isn't allowed to make zombie movies with a decent budget.  And if he does, it must suck.  Well for my money, Land of the Dead is a good movie.It's well written, well cast and of course expertly directed.  The effects are good.  The zombies look cool and are intelligent(for a change).  And there is of course the familiar Romero social subtext to the plot.  All in all it's a good ride and worth an hour and a half of your time if you like zombie movies.  If you don't like zombie movies, you're probably not reading this review anyways.",4,1

1296562,A Good Read,"The book was enjoyable and a good read, perhaps focusing a bit more on Albert than some other books I've read.  At the end of Chapter 20, the author refers to William Hartington Cavendish, ""the seventh Duke of Devonshire"" as the ""bachelor duke"" who took Joseph Paxton ""as his lifelong friend"".  That is an error.  It was the sixth duke, William George Spencer Cavendish, who was known as the bachelor duke and who made Paxton his gardener at Chatsworth (Hartington is the courtesy title typically given to the Duke's heir).  This seemed to me a very careless error and left me wondering whether the book contains other errors of fact.",4,1

5669164,Excellent,"My personal favorite Billy Joel album.  Each song seems to be a different style and has a different theme, but it is really an honest portrait of Billy, from who he was before the album, to who he was during the making of the album, and, interestingly enough, who he became in years to come.  The highlights are: This Is The Time, A Matter Of Trust, Baby Grand (duet with Ray Charles) and Temptation",5,1

7485101,Very pleased,"At first, we thought this size would be too large for the room, however, after ordering a 24&#34; we opted for this one. Because the new TVs don't have as large of a frame profile as the old TVs, this one provided the right size for our wall cosmetically.As far as the quality of the TV itself, we are very happy with the picture, sound, etc. The LEDs are so much nicer than my older LCD and mounting the unit on the wall is extremely easy due to the light weight on the LED.I have had good experiences overall with LG products.

2067952,Excellent character development,"Normally I seldom leave reviews, but this book had no reviews at this point, and it is definitely good enough that it deserves some.Best:excellent character development, especially the narrator, as well as all the other central characters, good, neutral or evil.  Seldom one-dimensional, the characters are usually fairly well rounded.Good:The effects of a nearby nuclear explosion seem to have been well researched, and the effects of this over a long period of time seem likely and believable.Poor:The scenario suggested that caused WWIII is extremely unlikely, and threw me out of the story for a few pages.  But this is a very peripheral part of the book, and one bad small note shouldn't destroy your appreciate of an otherwise fine performance.",4,1

8988508,GLORIFIED FAN FILM,"I am a fan of fan films, and very lob budget productions. However, even after watching this and giving the director/producer props for the effort, I found this movie to be pretty horrible (and that is being compared to other FF and LBP). Compared to the director's other films, Demon Summer being one of them, the film sill falls flat.The acting is of course bad, the characters are bad, the story is bad. The blood, well, it's LB and pretty alright for what we are dealing with.However, I did laugh alot with this film. The gay couple was a riot, and at the end when his paperclip chainmail armor saves his life---classic.Only buy this if you can get it used for under 2 bucks, also check out Demon Summer--which was an alright film.",2,0

2239719,Puts you right there with the Corps of Discovery.,"Warning!  Reading this book could make you a lifelong Lewis and Clark fan.  It happened to me. Since reading this book shortly after it was published I have been inspired to more thoroughly study the history of this expedition and even to trace its paths.  Today, as I am writing this, is the 200th anniversary of the expedition's crossing of the continental divide.  For years I had planned to be on Lemhi Pass on this date to commemorate the event.  But, as often occurs, events conspired against me, and instead I am home writing this review.  A few weeks ago, however, I did get the opportunity to travel the Lolo Trail where I visited several Lewis and Clark sites (including the trail itself).  It was a great trip.  Anyway, my life has changed for the better because of this book.

4499597,Easily the best title on the subject,"Troy Taylor does a fine job exposing his audience to the history and traditions of ghost hunting, despite painting with somewhat broad brushstrokes.  Expectations for any such book should be limited - nothing is going to tell you how to conduct a proper investigation except experience.  Nevertheless, the Guidebook should be plenty enough to give you the courage to get out there and look around, and might also save you the expense of buying a lot of pricey toys you don't really need.  Taylor treats the subject matter seriously, which is refreshing.  I would have really enjoyed a few more ""war stories"" taken from actual experience, but that's what Taylor's other books are for.",4,1

First, the soles are not as cushioned as the other model, probably because the newer sole seems to be of a different, harder material.  Also, because there was not as much &#34;give&#34; in the soles, the high arch -- which I like in the XLTs -- pressed painfully into my heel.

We find Ranger still keeping tabs on Stephanie, as Lula thinks Ranger is a superhero, since no one knows where he lives or comes from.  Of course we have Uncle Vinnie, Mom, Dad and Grandma Mazur.  And last but not least, Joe Morelli.  I am really enjoying the chemistry between Stephanie and Joe.  I love their little game of cat and mouse that they play with each other.  Chemistry is what has drawn me to this series.  Stephanie has chemistry with all the main characters in the book and to me it's rare to see that with this many characters.

615227,You've got to be kidding,"Obviously mine is not the popular opinion, but I found Excavation to be  terribly disappointing. Granted, I have not read Subterranean, so maybe I  was assuming too much of Rollins as an author. Still, from the Irish  character whose brogue comes and goes (and never actually convincingly), to  the ridiculous conclusion, I have to say that I felt I had wasted my time.  My apologies to his fans...obviously I'm in the minority. As fascinating as  the peripheral images of the book were, and even at times the plot itself,  I felt overall it was pretty disappointing. It gets one star for having an  interesting title, and one star for the character Denal. I did like him.",2,0

If you watch all of the Godzilla movies from the first to the last, you'll see Godzilla change in appearance & attitude. From a destructive vengeful creature to rubber-suited ""friend of man"" who goes to battle with other ""unwordly"" creatures to save mankind. THIS Godzilla is a real fun romp that does not hide it's comedy aspects & the agreed upon scientific theory that cockroachs will withstand armageddon & be the only creatures left after mankind destroys the planet. Having Godzilla and Anguilus ""talking"" to each other is funny! I have all but 4 of the Godzilla movies on DVD & I'm going to complete my collection soon (I have all of the VHS movies but I'm switching to DVDs because they will last longer). Many people don't like how Godzilla ""morphs"" from terrible monster to ""nice guy"" humankind helper throughout his movies but I enjoy all of his movies (even the ""bad"" ones) because that's Godzilla's history!",4,1
741864,Great Jump Start,"I've recently had a need to create some cross-platform applications and decided to look at Qt. While the Qt web site provides a great deal of information, I found this text to be a very readable way to quickly come up to speed on creating applications with Qt. Summerfield's prose moves the reader quickly from point to point with a series of short example programs and detailed breakdowns of hows and whys. I also own copies of other Summerfield books, and I've quite enjoyed the rapid learning experience they provide. The Python books (Learning Python / Programming Python / Programming in Python 3) provide more than enough detail for the experienced developer and gently take the novice forward as well. I'm looking forward to the upcoming Advanced Qt Programming book to continue to dive deeper into Qt development.",5,1

4235033,she has a 3 picture deal,"I was already biased towards this book because I like Carol Leifer. M's Leifer writes about her life in comedy with honesty and good humor. She speaks of auditioning for Johnny Carson for 21 times and not getting the gig. While M's Leifer  acknowledges breaking into comedy being more difficult for a woman than a man, she does not dwell upon it. (Although there are some advantages as M's Leifer  points out.). Her experiences with various comedians are entertaining as well as enlightening.But M's Leifer's life story is not just her biography. It is also a guide on how to conduct yourself in the business world. Every experience she relates can  be translated very easily into the working world situations. There is no short cut to success as M's Leifer points out.I recommend this book highly to any fellow Carol Leifer fans and any biography fans. And if you are looking for a guide for work, you couldn't ask for a better mentor than Carol Leifer.",5,1

It's below $1000 (which most L lens inversely cost) but the quality of the shots I've taken looks so professional. Only drawback is its f/4 maximum aperture. But as long as I'm taking pictures outdoors, the f/4 opening is just fine. I did try taking pictures with it indoors, I just have to push the setting to ISO1600 and sometimes pop up the flash and the pictures also turn out well. For an amateur like me, this lens is a very GOOD buy!",5,1

8771575,WHEN BOND WAS YOUNG,"There was a time when the James Bond movies were directed by real directors and not by the special effects team or a bunch of stuntmen. Yes ! And, at that time, there was a great actor who played James Bond, a no-name  guy who'll become Sean Connery. There was no need, then, of endless  explosions or multiple gunfights to please the audience. DR NO is terrific,  fast and should be showed to all these new directors who believe that they  have to destroy seventy cars while filming a car chase.  In one word, this  movie is refreshing. A DVD for Sean and Ursula fans.",4,1

Maybe it's because the dragon in this one, Alec, is just drop dead gorgeous. But I really think the reason is the quality of the writing. This book is engaging, funny, sexy, scary, and thrilling all at different times. Very well executed. All the elements were in place; good plot, believable characters, great pace, fun and sexy storyline, good relationship building throughout the book. Also the possibility of the book turning into another, maybe more. The ending left a few  things open for further exploration and I'm really hoping that Susannah does so. I started this book late in the day, and couldn't put it down until I finished it around midnight. Loved every page!

1641220,an enjoyable light read,"This book has the feel of a book written 60 years ago, in a good way. While this story has plenty of tragedy, it does have an innocence, and in many ways romanticizes a hard (and beautiful) life in northern Canada. This book has the feel of a young adult book rather than an adult book. I wish I had known about it when my children were younger - it would have been perfect to read to a 10-13 year old. It is a classic family novel. A nice follow-up to Little House on the Prairie. Much better, actually. As an adult, reading it for myself, it was a book I enjoyed, and it earns 4 stars for me, but it fell short of what I expect of a great novel. I'm glad I read it and I do recommend it to others, especially as an epic family read-aloud.",4,1

Personally I find John Shook's ""Managing to Learn"" more readable and a better introduction to the A3, though they do cover different ground and the one doesn't replace the other.If you want to know more about the A3 planning and problem solving process - that ties everything in lean together - this is a great place to start.",5,1

(Let's desist with the empiricism...),"It's the day before Christmas, 2005, so let us let fantasy be fantasy and mythology be mythology, and, following in Campbell's and Hillman's footsteps, recognize that fantasy and mythology have important powers and roles of their own. I suggest that we set aside how historically accurate this movie is or is not....all of that is besides the point.I really enjoyed this movie. I've watched most of Bruckheimer's (sp?) movies, but wouldn't consider myself a big fan of his...most of his movies seem a bit flat to me.This movie was different, in that it portrayed relationships and passion and decisions and freedom.I certainly had a few quibbles with it (a Pictish warrior woman would wear THAT into battle?), but again, those fall beside the point.I enjoyed this movie and was impacted by it. In short, the movie was much better than the major reviews led me to believe.that's what's important.be well.",4,1

1970997,Wonderful Characters- Not a great ending,"This book was a little difficult to get into at first.  I think it started out a little slow then picked up after a few chapters.  The author does a wonderful job of bringing the characters and settings to life.  However, I found the end to be somewhat of a anti climax.  It was almost as though the author was rushing to put a finish to it and wasn't sure how things should end up.  The story line between Grace and the soldier, although romantic, left me feeling a little confused.  Although it was obvious John was not the right man for her, the way Grace ended up with the soldier left me feeling as though I'd missed a chapter or two somewhere.  Not a bad read but a slightly weak ending.  Still I gave it four stars for pulling me into the story and keeping me there.",4,1

8023351,Easy to read and holds your attention,"I never read the Cruising to Love books, but I am very interested in it now that I have read this book.  It was a wonderful story that I was interested in from the beginning.  I read it within a fairly short amount of time.  The characters seemed realistic and charming, and their love story was unique and delightful to read.  It was a well-written story, and although it was a love story, it was never vulgar or uncomfortable to read.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes love stories.",5,1

I have used it heavily on a daily basis for over two years now.  It is not a speedy drive, but it is perfect for keeping in a USB drive full-time without much risk of it being pulled out or knocked out accidentally from the computer's USB jack.  I have backed up the data regularly to two other USB flash drives, one by Corsair and one by Verbatim.  The Corsair and Verbatim flash drives have since both failed after mild use, while the Lexar Echo ZE keeps going.  The only factor keeping it from getting 5 stars is the speed.  My only regret is that I did not buy another for use as back-up.",4,1
9419368,Dax Shepard is god.,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this. Today was my day to catch up on some movies. Hit And Run was fairly low on my list but I went with my gut and rented it. Boy was I surprised. I like Dax Shepard and believe he's underrated. I love both Kristen Bell and Kristen Chenoweth. Bradley Cooper is okay for women but I don't like him as much. This movie has to be one of the funniest movies ever made. Everyone is great in it. It's sweet , it's funny , and it has car chases. Need I say more.",5,1
9070610,Godless liberalism...ridiculous and pathetic....,"This series started off bad...got better and then got absolutely horrible. It made me sick. A homosexual that was killed was refered to as ""she"". And at the end of the show the father who killed the transvestite who was having relations with his son was told that he had killed a 115 lb ""girl"". And had sacrificed his only son on the altar for the sake of his own pride. Demonic overtones coupled with godless and ridiculous liberalism. No wonder this show flopped. If it was still on tv....I would never tune in again. Stick with all the other Law and Orders. Also try ""Homicide, Life on the street"". It is very very good. One detective goes a little gay during the end of its run, but besides that it is really good.",1,0

What is your identity? These are the three key questions asked in this book. Finding identity in Christ is the answer to everything, too many times we have problems in our lives evolve from false identity, this is exactly what Mark Dirscoll explains and disscuses in this book. I think that this book will be especially helpful for teens but also for adults who have never taken time to figure out who they are in Christ. Read it, you won't be disappointed.",5,1
2771401,Power to Women!,"Nawal El Saadawi's storytelling is unapologetic and I love it! I gained insight into another culture and enjoyed being educated on customs and beliefs I was unfamiliar with. Her controversial and feministic approach always creates good stories. I loved how she took a real life event and wrote a story for a woman that no longer has a voice to tell her own story. Although I read the book in an academic setting, I would still recommend it as a leisurely read.",5,1

1291792,Mr. Lucky Strikes It Big,"The long awaited next book from James Swain and his street smart investigator Tony Valentine has finally arrived and most certainly doesn't disappoint this avid reader/fan.  This is definitely Swain's best novel to date, more sophisticated than prior Valentine stories, but not at the expense of the reader.  The scams and deceptions Swain interweaves in this story are his best yet.  Vivid descriptions and character development caused the theatre in my mind to race in overtime, and leaves me wondering when Hollywood or Television will embrace this body of work.  I only hope they don't screw it up.As with Grift Sense, Funny Money, Sucker Bet and my prior favorite Loaded Dice, Mr. Lucky is a fast read (I raced cover to cover in three days).  I only hope Mr. Swain is fast at work on the next Tony Valentine story, which I await with great anticipation.",5,1

5413289,Entertaining with several interesting social threads.,"Characters fun to read, especially the main character, an older than usual male lead with a believable welcome blend of positive and troublesome traits.  The plot line moved along briskly and had enough turns and twists to keep me going easily.  Plus, one of the best opening scenes I can recall.  Stuck with me for months as I waited for the full book to come out (had read the opening scene on the author's website.)  I think with the continued development of the character's aging aspects, even fuller integration of social issues into the plot (already well done), I truly believe we could be looking at the evolvement of a very solid enduring 5 start story.  From this story, I can see this happening.",4,1

I am going to add another of these to replace my old Roku player. I have been using Western Digital products for over 40 years now.

The young man who did this is found dead at the scene. Deborah has picked up the hammer used in the killing and therefore could be a suspect. As the story unwinds, her brother is in hopital from arsenic poisoning and the young man who was killed also had arsenic in his blood. The ending is a surprise but very good. I could see the town and the people in my mind as the story progressed. As very good book with what I would call a light mystery. If you want horror and gore, try Patricia Cornwell or John Sandford. I can relate to the family ties that are in the book. Just all around very good.",5,1

How can the History Channel refer to these fools as experts? They are a bunch of science fiction authors who try to pass off their crazy ideas as facts.

The only thing about this series that I have liked is the ancient locations they visit, but every time their ""experts"" open their mouths I have to laugh. Such a lame cast.",1,0

615771,The beginning to a delightful series!,"Lorraine Heath is an author that, for whatever reason, never gets enough shelf notice at bookstores.  She is in the league of Kleypas, Laurens, and Medieros... and can write circles around Johanna Lindsey when it comes to believable historical romance fiction.With Morgan and Claire's we see an estranged marriage that could go either way... of course we know how it will go, but still throughout the story we are never entirely sure.  There are tears and laughter as only Ms. Heath can do with success.  She is able to write dry wit and tear-jerking scenes with equal aplomb.  Her characters are believable and she knows her Regency history!  I love everyone in this book and am eager to get her other books to see how their stories turn out.I'm really curious as to whether or not she will write a more elaborate story of Tessa and Leo (Morgan's 40-something widowed mother and her 20-something artist lover).

Conason does a great job of debunking the &quot;lies&quot; of the right and how they've distorted just about everything they write or say about the left.  Conservatives paint themselves as the heroes of the downtrodden, the saviors of the country, and chosen of God.  Well, if their's one thing Conason does is show that load crap for what it is, and unlike the Coulters of the world, he doesn't pull a few bits and scraps from a Lexis-Nexis search then try to create a distortion around it.  It's just the facts, ma'am.  This is a great companion to Franken's Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them.",5,1

She eats peanut butter and jelly on her burrito, and she never chooses one things to be when playing games. Marisol does not match and that is perfectly fine with her, even if the other kids don't agree. I think this book is a great way to teach children that it's okay to be different. It's okay to like things that other's might not like and do what others might not want to do. As long as you enjoy it then what others think doesn't matter.",5,1

At her first mention of Rec Park (Recreation Park) where Jonah makes his first appearance, I waited for Liz to describe the carousel that all of us kids walked past on our way to junior high school.  She didn't, but I still saw it.  Last time I was in town the carousel was still going.  To her credit Liz didn't romanticize the town:  her descriptions all rang true and were the perfect backdrop for the story.Beautifully written.  Oh, did I already say that?  Read it.  You'll see what I mean.",5,1

""Unchosen Love"" was just beautiful, as was ""Paradises Lost"", and the tales from Seggri were fascinating, if slightly disturbing. Although ""Old Music...""

I found this one and bought it immediately - even working at Macy's she couldn't find a better tea pot than this for a better price. It's beautiful! And it works great! No flaws. You won't find this anywhere else as good as this one is!,5,1

1223843,Not for the faint of heart,"One of the main things separating J. K. Rowling from many authors of Literary Fiction is that she doesn't pretend to pull her punches. You pretty much know at the outset what she does and doesn't like, and yet, like any of the best writers of social satire (T. C. Boyle comes to mind) she can show us how much she dislikes someone without demonizing them -- while at the same time avoiding the sanctification of heroes.It's a powerful book, and not for the faint of heart, including frank and thankfully non-prurient depictions of teen sexuality, drug abuse, teen and adult mental illness, and rape.",5,1
1408321,The Cowboy's Courtship (Love Inspired),Alyson Anderson was looking for her Grandmother and did not know she had a twin sister or was even a Forester. Her mother was only interested in Alyson's career as a concert pianist. Jason Bradshaw was determined to go back to bull riding after his injury healed. Working at Camp Hope was helping him more than he knew. Good book.,5,1
785796,A blazing fast and memorable read,"Take something like Charlottes Web and blend it with the Russian Revolution, shake it up a bit and you have Animal Farm.Animal Farm is a satirical look at totalitarianism, complete government control. The animals are sick of the humans controlling them. They are underfed and caged up and just generally mistreated. The animals decide to start a revolution and they successfully drive the humans away. The pigs are known as the intellectuals so they quickly become the leaders of the animals, Napoleon the bore being the one in charge. With the pigs in charge how much will life really improve?Orwell's prose in this book is absolutely flawless. The scenes really jump out of the pages. Right in the beginning Orwell drops quite a large cast of characters for such a quick read but he fleshes them out so perfectly (and succinctly) that you won't become lost.This is a blazing fast read! Orwell doesn't waste a single word. This is a very memorable book. I can't imagine giving it anything less than 5 stars.",5,1
4246892,LOVE it!,"I couldn't keep my hands off this book! I'd put it down and have to pick it back up again. I had to get to the end and find out what all happened.I really can't decide if I like Sam or Jennifer more. Both characters, different in their own ways, were both delightful, wholesome, loving characters. They had personalities that were personable and made you want to get to know them.The morals that came across in this story, like love, trust and acceptance, were told solidly. It will continue to resonate through me for some time.I think lots of people will enjoy this book. Even Stephen King fans. It has a pretty groovy, scary element and suspenseful feel throughout that horror and thriller fans will greatly appreciate.",5,1
6616971,It does the job well.,"I was skeptical, replacing my five year-old plastic mouse pad that came with an Alienware laptop, with a cloth mouse pad. The Alienware mousepad had been worn so smooth in the center, that tracking had started to become erratic, although the edges of the pad still worked, having retained the original texture.Came here to Amazon. Found the reviews for the SteeSeries QcK Gaming Mouse Pads. Bought one. Tried it for the last month. Works fabulous. Tracking is fine. The mousepad's rubber backing makes it not slip on my glass top desk.Definitely recommend.",5,1
6028081,One of my all time favorites!,"And i own thousands od CDs and records. The non convention structure of sounds and layout of the songs are incredible. There are elements of heavy metal, classic psychedelic rock, blues and more. This album pulls me into the right atmospheric moods, it carries a vibe I much can relate to. The lyrics are not understandible at times but it works on a very abstract level. I'm surprised this band isn't known more, why? They're better than some of the best known indie bands out there. Guitar pedal fanatics will surely love this band. Get this album!",5,1
1595132,Not so much a biography as a diary of a friendship,"Mostly, ""Kate Remembered"" is Scott Berg's love letter to his mentor and friend.

9377283,Amazing,"100x better than the original anime. I loved how this followed the manga's storyline almost exactly. The brothers also seemed more 'human' in this one and there were a little less ridiculous outbursts from Ed about being short. It was graphically much better as well, but that likely is due to it being Blu-Ray while the original is DVD. The graphics on these discs are nothing short of amazing. I don't think I've seen better animation in any other anime Blu-Ray.",5,1
3088456,Juicing Diet Review,"I highly enjoyed reading this book. &#34;The Juicing Diet&#34; offers a good introduction for those not familiar with the concept of juicing. The author lets the reader know to clean their fruits and vegetables, what types can be utilized, the types of juicers that are used, and listing a variety of recipes to use. Sonoma Press keeps the option of juicing affordable in their suggestions and providing the 150 recipes list. The book mentions this does not have to be primary part of a diet, but this is a good concept to include in a healthy diet overall. I will keep this book in my library for reference. It is very useful to have.",4,1

5001941,Patterson is a wizard at keeping you turning the pages,"I don't normally read a lot of witches or supernatural books but this one kept my attention. I think it's more a teen / tween book, which is probably the target market. I expect the younger crowd will love this one. I did. As expected, Patterson is a wizard at keeping you turning the pages.  I also enjoyedSkull Creek Stakeouta middle grade, scary, funny, mystery andPurple Moona teen angst story about a young girl who has to go live with her rich aunt.",4,1
8582650,A must-see for photographers,"There's a deeper understanding for this movie from photographers, especially pro-level amateurs who keep a day job to support themselves. Almost anyone familiar with the so-called &quot;art scene&quot; will also find many poignant moments. There's a lot of visual and verbal innuendos, so it's great viewing the second and third time around. John Waters fans will love it.",5,1

8049979,Interesting no matter what your persuasion,"This book is interesting because it discusses flirting and its history.  I had no idea that so many people have studied flirting and that so much has been written about flirting.

3576845,Fun vacation read,"Sure, the character development could be better, but this was a pretty good book.  The historical mindset of 17th century Czechoslovakia was very interesting, and the story was gripping.

Sometimes when an author has too much buildup to the actual sex, it can be a big let down. Not the case here. The sex scenes were fantastic, whew...just really good!",5,1
6548450,Works Perfect.,"I bought this to replace a Sony version that I was borrowing from someone.  The Sony always got stuck in the tape deck because the cable ran out the top of the cassette and would get caught.  On the Belkin Xm, the cable comes directly out the back of the cassette so it ejects perfectly and won't wear on the cable over time.It sounds perfect.  I am using it with an iPod touch and often listen to podcasts and music.  There is no background noise, it plays evenly in all speakers and does exactly what it is made to do.  No reason to pay any more than 5.99 to get your electronic device playing through your car stereo.The cord is really long, in fact it's a bit too long for my purposes but I simply used a twisty tie to keep it from getting tangled.  However, it would be nice for anyone who wants to hand control of the mp3 player to the person in the backseat.",5,1

They both bring their defects to the table too.It could have so easily become a story of forbidden love but stayed on a higher plain.

1286035,Bee-Zarre!,"John Saul spins a &quot;queen&quot; of a tale with this one.  I've read plenty of Saul's novels, this is among the best.It seems all of Saul's works include children, secret medical experiments, and the tearing apart of families becuase of it.  This one is along those lines, but the experimentation is not necessarily intentional.  I'll leave what happens to the reader.  It's WICKED GOOD!Although there isn't as much suspense in The Homing as I'm used to out of Saul, there is more horror that I like to see in his writings.If you are a fan of John Saul, check this one out.  You won't be disappointed.",4,1

You'll find yourself rooting for the main character, August Pullman, and those who befriend him. He's a boy who will make a difference in this world.  Once you read his story you'll look at things differently. We all have something to overcome, it just so happens Auggie wears his hardship on his face. There are so many lines and phrases that stand out I this novel; the writing is second to none. I cried with and for Auggie and his family. I laughed with them. I cheered for them and felt their pain. Thank you R.J. Palacio for giving us this amazing ten year old. Don't miss a chance to read Auggie's story. You'll learn that strength and kindness are contagious.",5,1
952327,Palahniuk is to liturature what Tarentino is to film,"Chuck Palaniuk is a light in a literary word littered with pansy love stories and chick flick screen plays.  Palahniuk's story of anti-hero Victor Mancini is dark, twisted & hysterically funny.  That being said, not everyone will like this book.  Palahniuk is raw and at times obscene.  Choke is incredibly so.  I imagine a lot of people will be offended by some of the language in this book.  If you don't look through the words and into the minds of the characters, all you'll read is obscenities.  For example, some of Victor's sexual exploits are described in graphic detail.  However, I felt as though Palahniuk did an amazing job of removing all sexual excitement from the scenes and making them the emotionless exploits of a helpless addict.  I'd love to go further with this, but it may ruin some of the scenes for those who haven't read it yet.  If you're intrigued by dark, twisted humor with a touch of cultural commentary mixed in, (and if you're not offended by words alone) you'll love this book.",4,1

6786989,Definately the MOST stunning picture I've EVER seen on a TV...,"It likely goes without saying that 240mHz makes a big difference.  However, when I had my HD service installed by Comcast on this TV, even the technician said, ""WOW, that picture is unreal! Is this a 240?  It's like the people are walking around in 3D.""  I couldn't agree more!  It's simply the most amazing television I've ever owned.So, beyond my ""shock and awe"" I've owned a 50"" Panasonic Plasma and a 37"" LCD.  Those two PALE in comparison! Even using a Bluray player on my 50"" plasma (also in 1080p)the picture is EVEN BETTER!  I didn't even realize it was possible!My one caution for this setup, you better like HD reality.  Many shows in HD or movies on Bluray look so real, you literally feel like you're there.  I watched an episode of House last night and thought the clarity and film work was so drastically different that it almost look more like filming of a soap opera.  It's taking some getting used to that's for sure!I can't wait to try the Amazon On-Demand HD movies!!",5,1
7176445,These are great...,"I reviewed my previous set of JVC HAFX5R Gumy headphones and to put it simply I was extremely pleased with those.  Now we have the pro version of the same headphones and I must admit I am over the moon with these.  They fit just as well, if not better, IF...IF that is possible and apparently it is. I got these because I liked the regular Gumy so much as a backup and now they are the backups. The bass response is even more awe inspiring as their predecessor and just as crisp and clean as well. JVC did it right with this series of headphones for sure.  I am convinced that anyone else that tries these will say the same...they are in fact amazing for such small in the ear headphones, since they seem to hold their own even when compared to the much larger over the ear models of headphones. Can't go wrong with these.",5,1

I unplug it every night in hopes to keep its lifespan long.  If you plan to hide this deep back in the corner, that might not be ideal.

1659403,Fascinating yet disappointing tale of Van Gogh's and his lover's fate,"Sad story of characters trapped in the societal norms of their era. Though main characters are well drawn, I found myself tiring of the relentless male domination and self-deceiving arrogance of the father figure. He virtually enslaved his daughter, kept her from Van Gogh, the man she loved, and eventually destroyed the health of the painter he was hired to cure. His daughter out of wedlock was the one element in the book where courage moved beyond traditional scripts. Although I'm an art-lover the fate of the heroine in this novel failed in my estimation as a satisfactory resolution to its narrative build-up.",4,1

Occasionally their songs have an upbeat and rogueish soul quality, vocals drawled in a heavy Scottish brogue over a curious Glaswegian Motown beat, but it is the slower and more spacious songs on which Arab Strap truly shine.  'The Long Sea' is easily this album's finest, showcasing chiming guitars and meandering keyboards with a Middle Eastern quality that are later overwhelmed by a wall of rich and sumptuous feedback.",4,1

1021231,What I really liked about the book is Wiseman&#8217;s conscientious and respectful approach,"This is a neatly-crafted and thoughtful exploration, in the form of a kind of parent handbook, of the social development of young men. What I really liked about the book is Wiseman&#8217;s conscientious and respectful approach; she thinks of young sons as human beings, and offers practical suggestions for addressing and helping boys to form good behaviors and, ultimately, a solid character. She does this not through coaxing or cajoling, but through real-life examples, all the while explaining the emotional and psychological implications for the boy. In addition to exploring adolescent terminology (which is temporal and maybe not necessary for many readers), sociological contexts and explanations, and warning signs for problems, Wiseman is a pragmatic and empathetic thinker. I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with all the conclusions she arrives at, but I admire her tackling of this under-examined arena of human development.",4,1

After buying it, I eagerly began to devour the words of the book, and I just couldn't stop reading. In a few days, I finished this deliciously dark and incredible novel.Compared to the movie that was based on this, this novel was WAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better than the slightly cheesy anime movie. I hated how in the movie, they destroyed how the characters originally looked in the book (D's supposed to be wearing black, not blue; Doris has black hair, not red hair, and her outfit is completely ridiculous in the movie; Larmica is a blonde, not blue-haired; and Rei-Singei is supposed to be exceedingly good-looking, but in the movie, well, he looks really stupid and weird.).This book was worth what I payed for it. I recommend this to vampire lovers, and, of course, fans of the vampire hunter d movies.",5,1

I ordered and used the Belkin 4&#34; Lightning cable and leave it attached to the Jackery. (see my review of that)note:  you have to double click the switch to get the flashlight to turn on.

7151822,"Feels good, but does degrade screen quality","I bought this screen protector expecting it to degrade the screen quality to a degree.  I have yet to find a matte finish, anti-glare screen protector that doesn't.  As far as they go, this one is very good.  It was the easiest application I have ever performed.  I also enjoy the matte feeling, but that is a personal preference, of course.  It definitely delivers on cutting the glare.  You lose the glossy beauty of the screen, but it makes it much more functional under bright light conditions.  Also, to get multiple protectors at this price is a great deal considering the same type of protector from bigger names would cost you three times as much (easily) for one protector.  I recommend this product if you're looking to cut the glare and can handle a small amount of degradation.  If not, I would assume that the non-matte version by the same company is just as good and would give that a try.",4,1

The film details the painter's struggles with the govenment of the city and with his own family.This is a rarely seen Korda film that has some great performances although it was not seen as a success when it was released. Many of the problems related to stresses between Korda and Laughton.

Although this book is not really about Chopin, Poland or his music, the crime story was quite interesting and plot was viable enough for me wanting to finish this book as soon as possible. The only problem (maybe not) I had with this book, it was a bit too short. And because so many writers took on different chapters, one could easily notice different styles and feelings. In general it's a very quick page-turner with solid and fast-paced plot.",4,1

When she's on, she's magnificent.  In this book she comes off very close to the latter.  I would say this is one of her better books.",4,1

Codes are right, remote just doesn't support them.  BAD RCA!  Don't put codes in your manual that your devices don't support!!!  That's just BAD!

Faolan running into Tara- the girl he was sure was a shifter too- brought in a luscious male/female interaction to balance the tense, but sensuous time with the men. I loved the romance, sex, and suspense that built as the shifter element became more active in the story. I am sure I went &#34;aww&#34; when the book wrapped up, leaving me wanting to know what happens with these gorgeous shifters and their nontraditional relationship. I immediately went in search of book 2 &#34;Shifting Perspectives&#34;- which unfortunately hasn't been released yet.",5,1

I've had this knife now for about a year and it's just a joy to use.  Despite all of my other knives, I find myself constantly picking this one out of the block.  It cuts so effortlessly, it's almost magical.  This is not a light-weight knife, it has heft and size; but it's so well balanced in my (largish) hands that it slices effortlessly through whatever meats or vegetables I throw its way.  Chopping onions is almost a pleasure with it, and I used to hate prepping onions.In the year I've owned it, I've used it probably several times most every day.  At least once a day I run it over Global's ceramic sharpening rod and I've had it professionally sharpened once.  It remains incredibly sharp and friction free when slicing.  Somehow I've recently put two nicks in the front inch of the blade, I hope my local knife sharpener can work these out because I love using every inch of this knife.",5,1
7464742,Wow,"Did research and read reviews prior to purchase, thought was going to be a good product but it ended up being a great product. Sound bar standlone has incredible rich sound using opitical input. Subwoofer and satellite speakers sound great when turned on. Calibrating it to my liking took no time at all using the remote. Only negative is satellite speaker wires are to short for where I wanted them but that is not a Vizio issue rather a furniture placement issue. Purchased longer wires and have no complaints.

7388506,Good Budget Case,"good budget case for those who don't want to immediately spend $$$ on a metal box to stick their components in. decent non-gaudy look to it with a lot of options for entry level cooling. It won't fit a H100 but it will fit a H60 and will probably fit an H80. Not extraordinarily solid, but it gets the job done. Don't care for the drive cages because they are made of plastic, restrictive in airflow, and the SSD compartment is in a different position, which makes routing power cables a bit of a pain if you want to use the SSD compartment. Also the SSD compartment holds onto drives a little firmly (which in my case is rubbing off the warranty sticker on the SSD, so beware). but it's a great budget case nonetheless which has many premium features like cable routing holes, a PSU dust filter, filtered air intakes and a good front panel hub with USB 3.0 (internal header). would highly recomend for a decent budget build.",4,1

The novel is an enjoyable read, and the characters are engaging. I especially liked the attention to detail incorporated into every scene. Being a writer myself, I find description very hard to write, and am in awe as to how well and seamlessly, Ms. Hoffmann weaves it throughout ever chapter.I would have loved to given this novel the full five star rating, but typos and grammar issues were slightly distracting. Also, I would have liked to have seen a bit more character building on the part of the hero.

I found it to be exciting but perhaps not up to the hype.The character of Lisbeth is brilliantly drawn and unforgettable, and I look forward to reading Larsson's other books featuring her. I, for one, found the central mystery to be fascinating and the solution both fair and difficult to predict. Where I had a problem was with the Wennerstrom subplot: I expected much more to come of this, and the book's ending, tying up that loose end, was ultimately unsatisfying. Larsson never really connects that subplot with the mystery involving Harriet Vanger. Ultimately, that makes the book too long.Frankly, I was less impressed with Lisbeth's computer hacking skills, which almost seemed like a form of magic that Larsson inserted. than with the creative use of photography to solve the mystery.",4,1

She's hiding a werebear cub in her house but is far too stubborn to admit it. Getting her to let him into her home isn't happening so how will he ever convince her to let him into her heart? Ty's day is about to get much worse before it gets better!Fabulous fun to read as Ty struggles to chase down his mate and I loved Mia as she is one tough cookie!

In ""Spade and Archer,"" Gores tempts hubris by daring to impersonate Hammett himself, writing a prequel to the classic ""The Maltese Falcon.""  Frankly, Gores does such a good job imitating Hammett, that I almost forgot this ISN'T Hammett.  This is an excellent choice for the Dashiel Hammett fan, but more importantly, the book works on its own, and can be enjoyed even by readers unaware of Hammett or ""The Maltese Falcon.""",4,1
2200314,Another Good Traditional SF Novel,"Having read K.D Wentworth's BLACK ON BLACK, I kniew what to expect -- somewhat.  This time she focuses on three alien species, not counting the humans, and brings them all off well.  She has the ability to make the reader care about even minor characters.  The story is pretty traditional SF again, which is not my preferred reading, but Wentworth's book kept me up late at night after I should've gone to sleep &quot;just gotta finish this/the next chapter.&quot;  While not perfect, this is a very good read.",4,1
6105625,"A Great, Quirky Listen","It's tough to place this group and album in a genre - and that's refreshing. Certainly the group relies heavy upon electronic sound, but they're not really electronica. They have a very 70s rock-opera vibe but with a modern approach.Many of the songs are quite catchy, although some (4th Dimensional Trnsition) are quite psychedelic. The music is heavily layered and rich, making an album that's fun to listen to again and again.The duo's vocals and lyrics are quirky, but work well overall.",4,1
3707278,"Very well done, very interesting","The subject was a bit suspect at first,but turned out to be handled very well, very believably.  I enjoyed the descriptions, the tales, the moves from one place to another.  It was a very well written tale, very enjoyable.",5,1
8178590,A great edition which won't disappoint,"This book contains three bestselling health and fitness books in one volume. I am sure people who are familiar with some of the books in the author's well-established Fit Expert Series will greatly appreciate this. The Best Exercises Collection contains approximately twenty contributions from fitness and health experts. You could say, there is something for everybody, guaranteed. This is a great edition which I am happy to recommend.",5,1
4790405,Don't read unless you read the book!,Well I am always optimistic when I see a prequel that I will get an insight on how the author writes and if I want to read the the next book.  Unfortunately I did not get that vib from this short story.  This series does not do it for me I am sorry to say.  Happy reading!,1,0
7876539,GREAT COOKING TOOL,"As one who cooks with lots of garlic, I love this product! You can fit up to 3 or 4 garlic cloves at a time, it's easy to grab it even if you have small hands like I do and once you squeeze it, the garlic comes out in small pieces. The screen is removable for easy cleaning and it's machine washable. I highly recommend this cooking tool, a must for garlic lovers!",5,1

Great read!!!!!",5,1
2702036,Troubling Yet Not Surprising,"Matt Taibbi. Yeah, the guy is a flaming liberal and not someone with whom I would generally agree, but this book was spot on. Anyone who deals with the market or follows what has gone on in this country for any length of time, knows that the &#34;gap&#34; between the affluent and the poor has expanded at a frightening rate. I would say that I &#34;enjoyed&#34; this book, however that would not be the correct phrase. It angered me, frustrated me and, at times, brought me to tears. No matter what &#34;side&#34; of the political fence you may be on, this is a book well worth reading. Will it change anything in America? I doubt it because I believe it is too late for that. What is eventually going to take place in this country will be not unlike what took place in 1776. This time, however, my 66 years tell me that it will be far worse and much more painful. Put down your remote, put away your golf clubs and do your own homework and see what YOU think.",5,1
939217,Disappointed,"I thought I would love this book.  I eagerly awaited its arrival from my book club.  I was so disappointed.  The premise seemed so promising but instead, I found the book predictable and unbelievable at times.  The strangest feeling I had was that I didn't like ANY of the characters and that's a first for me.  I didn't care if any of them were in danger.  None of them were likable -- especially the heroine and her hunky boyfriend.  I had to force myself to finish the book hoping the whole time that it would get better.  This is coming from someone who adores a good novel full of mystery and intrigue.",1,0
8787896,Difficult Dialog and Story,This was a difficult movie to watch and it simplified the drug using life. The Scottish dialect was very hard to follow but since there didn't seem to be a plot thread it didn't matter.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.,1,0

4538874,Gooseberry Patch - A First-Time Purchase,"I've grown up seeing Gooseberry Patch books on bookshelves of friends and family, as well as tons lined up at the bookstores I frequent.  Yet I never bought one until now, feeling the desire for some good comfort food.  Well, this quaint little book doesn't disappoint.  It's filled with page after page of yummy recipes from all over the U.S., plenty of variety for anyone to try.  Can't wait to try the macaroni and cheese recipes!",5,1

3035269,Revenge all wrapped up in Crazy!,"This book grabbed me immediately and drug me headfirst into the story line. I felt like I was a great friend to the characters and observing their story from afar. On several occasions I found myself yelling at the book - ""NO! Don't do that!"" or ""Kiss her, already, you silly fool!"" The characters are believable, interesting and yet mysterious. It is a captivating love story all tucked up neatly inside a suspenseful thriller.Mary writes a solid book, edited with great care. Her character development is stunning.My favorite line in the book is: ""The crazy bitch wasn't going to smear her reputation just to get revenge on her ex-boyfriend."" OOOH.. Revenge all wrapped up in crazy. I loved it!",5,1
2214957,You'll Find Yourself in Here,"This book is unabashadly honest.  Mothers who are hard on themselves (find me one who isn't!) will find themselves in these pages in refreshingly forgiving and honest ways.  Some of these essays have laugh out loud moments, and about every one is well written and poignant.  Every topic that might concern a mom is represented here:  abandonment, anger, boredom, illness, single parent issues, sibling rivalry, and so on. I received this book as a gift and took a while to get around to reading it (almost three years).  I wish I had picked it up sooner; it would have brought me so much delight and comfort even sooner.",5,1
8382794,What to Feed Your Baby?,"There are a number of theories going around on what's the proper diet for your infant, and this book breaks it all down for you, first and most importantly, not by ingredients but by nutritional allowances: How much protein, iron, vitamins, etc. From there, you can build a nutritious diet for your baby for optimal health and growth. A solid guide.",5,1
7050240,Not functional,"I have a hard time understanding how this has gotten good reviews. 1) The clips tend to slip out of their rubber 'feet' if any sort of real tension is applied (liked having your flash at an angle), potentially falling to the floor and damaging my flash. Without the rubber pieces, the clamp does not seem to be able to hold on to anything. Maybe it was supposed to be glued and wasn't? Also, no matter how hard to tighten the ballhead, the flash will tend to creep downwards (potentially putting enough stress on the clip to cause problem #1). The verdict: useless, and more importantly, dangerous for your expensive flash!",1,0
2002504,Necessary Read,"Not always an easy read, but a necessary read.  No matter what the left states, the facts reveal the truth.  President Kennedy was deeply religious and anti communist.  Yes, he has foibles, but it is clear that he loved the United States,  and unlike our current President, he viewed America as exceptional compared to other countries.  This book with all of its quotes from Kennedy contradicts the liberal belief that Kennedy was one of theirs.  If you doubt, just read this.  The facts based on his speeches cannot be disputed.",4,1
7192159,Roo Case - I love it.,This is a great case.  The fire fits securely and the velcro actually sticks.  I love that you can stand it up or sit it down.

573456,The Red Leather Diary,I really liked the slice of history from the point of view of a 15-19 year old girl from 1929-1933. What Manhattan offered then and how independent and modern thinking she was. A really good read.,5,1
4520532,A compelling and beautiful novel,"Leora Skolkin-Smith has given us the gift of a beautifully crafted novel set in a time and place of change and turmoil. Every scene pulled me further into the story and held me captive. The author is as much poet as novelist, with each lilting phrase somehow revealing an entire story. Tight writing, nothing wasted, the purest form of literature. I was sure that I knew where the story was headed...and I was wrong. Every page will surprise.",5,1

6160672,Classic Rory with a red-hot live bonus CD!!,"This is one of Rory's best albums! Great songs! Rory is widely heralded as being underrated (an ironic phrase--lol) for his guitar playing, but I consider his songwriting abilities equal to his guitar playing! Great songs with enough hooks to make them catchy, but not ""sell-out"" tunes written strictly for Top 40 radio by any means (Rory was always against writing for the radio rather than writing straight from the heart)! Some songs are better than others, of course, but overall a solid outing. The live CD? Awesome!! Rory is just on fire, with a great blend of fingering and slide playing! His BEST playing that I've heard live--I'm serious!! If you're a Rory fan (or are interested in getting into his music), do NOT hesitate to buy this 2 CD set!! A great deal!!!",5,1
8971139,I Have Waited So Long,"Due to the negative reviews, I have waited too long to buy this DVD. I had it in my wish list for ages.  Fortunately, I recently had the opportunity to watch this DVD on a videostore and I realized that my fears were unfounded.This DVD reviews have mentioned too many complains about the video or production quality, and although I don't disagree with some of these comments, its flaws aren't that great so as to detract from the real pleasure of owning this DVD... watching Foreigner at arguably, their peak.The concert video and sound are very good, more so considering this is not a recent tour.  This concert is based on the The Very Best ... and Beyond Tour, and I watched them in Caracas, Venezuela during this tour.  It was an amazing concert.  This DVD captures its spirit and showcases the great setlist Foreigner played during the tour.I do not regret at all buying this DVD, this is Lou and Mick at their very best, great songs, great energy.  For real Foreigner fans, this is a must.",4,1
8811275,"""AWWWWW...Benji!""","Few can argue that the beloved golden mixed breed dig Benji will always stay in the hearts of movie goers everywhere. Released in 1974 on a measly budget of $500,000 the film &#34;Benji&#34; made a whopping $45,000,000 at the box office and made Benji a household name.The film finds Benji walking around in rural Texas where he befriends two children and a female dog who looks like him. When the two children are kidnapped it is up to Benji to rescue them.The plot may sound lame, but the film is great and a movie all children should see at least once in their lives.Charley Rich recorded the them to the film called &#34;I Feel Love&#34; that went on to garner an Academy Award nomination as Best Song!",5,1

2013137,Inspiring,"I had been looking for books on meditation, and bought ""Mindfulness in Plain English"", which is also great, by the way. However, I was told that ""Peace is Every Step"" could be more inspiring, because it wasn't intended to be a kind of manual (the kind that simply says ""do this, do that""). Well, it is true. ""Peace is Every Step"" does not teach meditation the way I wanted, and for that ""Mindfulness in Plain English"" was perfect. But ""Peace is Every Step"" was what I needed to get meditation to be part of my whole life, and not only half an hour of my day. In other words, ""Mindfulness in Plain English"" taught me how to do it. ""Peace is Every Step"" taught me what to do with it, and taught me meditaton is much more. It made meditation become part of my daily life. Now I understand why I was told it is inpiring.",5,1

It stays in place, but I'll probably tack it on with a touch of silicone glue so as not to worry about it.When I first got it, it didn't want to charge the phone unless I tilted the phone slightly forward.

I also pre-clean the screen with a anti static cloth.  I used the cold air from a hair drier to make sure the glass surface is dust free prior to attaching the plastic screen protector.

The authors leave enough space to write in the book.  And at this price, you will want to write all over it.  I have had less luck with workbooks that ask for a paragraph, but make you enter it in your own notebook.Also there is a good glossary at the end of the book so you can easily look up unknown words without having to lug your dictionary around.I can't say enough good.  Buy it.",5,1

Although the others have had substance and charm, this reads as if it were written for and by a fifteen year old.  The characters were underdeveloped and there was little or no plot, just a very predictable and sugary sweet ending. I missed the characters who came together to knit and share their heartaches and dreams at ""A Good Yarn"". Sadly, this book, although pleasant enough, just does not belong on Blossom Street.  What a big disappointment!  I just can't understand all the five star reviews!!",2,0
3207910,Public school teachers every where could write this!,"Immediately, I could tell that this teacher/author was telling the real story of many public schools in the U.S.  This book should be read by the public--parents, grandparents, advocates for education.  Most teachers cannot tell parents how badly they are being treated by the administrators.  Or how their children are not receiving the services they should receive.  Children are over-tested.  Teachers have no choice but to teach to the test.  In some places, the teaching is even scripted for the teacher.  How could any student sit through that.  We need parents, grandparents, etc. to start figuring out what is happening in our public schools.  Read this book!",5,1

I remember the old series from my youth and I thought them at the time some of the coolest and scariest comics around.  Unfortunately as I reread the stories they are not always first class.

But I finally decided to read the sample anyway, and was instantly hooked. I was in the middle writing my ninth novel, my first thriller, and was having doubts. Would it be a book that people would love enough to tell their friends about it? Would the story continue to haunt them for days, months, years? Would they remember my characters as though they were real people?That's what I wanted for my book, and James N. Frey helped me get it.My writing has improved as I wrote each of my novels, but this book (and all four of James N. Frey's other writing books, which I quickly bought and read after loving this one) helped me skip forward into my writing future--instantly gaining the knowledge of having written several more books by simply reading and applying his advice.I highly recommend this book!",5,1

The only thing I didn't like was there are no instructions regarding what all the keys do, and I had to visit various websites just to find out the basics.  Also, I kinda played around with some of them and figured them out, but a tiny manual or chart showing the keys and what they did would be nice.

And it's not like I did not like the story, I just did not like the main character. She was bratty and annoying and she spoiled the story for me.As for the story, it was nice enough, but I kept feeling there was more that could be done with it. And maybe it was kept vague because there's going to be a next story, but I still think it could have something more substantial, more solid to it.",2,0

9103153,This film could have been so much better...,"**Spoilers**I really wanted to like this movie but I found myself giggling at the 'love' story between Eisenheim (Norton) and Sophie (Biel). Edward Norton and Jessica Biel have no chemistry whatsoever due to Jessica's lack of talent, which in turn, makes Edward look hammy and over-doing it.And really, was no one expecting the end? Did anyone really believe Jessica's character was really dead? I also don't think writers really allowed the childhood friendship-crush pan out so the rest of the movie is rather forced and predictable. I have great respect for Edward Norton and would watch anything he's in but sometimes, even his accent was questionable. The romance is painfully, and sadly comical but the technical point in which the film was shot is beautiful. If not for Biel's ability to ruin every movie she's in, and if the plot was panned out more evenly, I think this film would have been better. But for the most, I was disappointed.",2,0
4172764,Book does what it promises,"This is a very simple review to write.  The book does what it promises.  Left hand page is the text of the play, to the right what each character says is given the literary equivalent of subtitles in colloquial english.For example, a character says about men in a shipwreck: ""Not a hair perished.  On their sustaining garments not a blemish, but fresher than before.""Confused? Look to the translation on the opposing page: ""Nobody was hurt in the slightest.  Even their clothes were unstained, and look fresher than before the storm.""Works better than a mere glossary because it puts the meaning of the characters' statements into 21st century English.  And Shakespeare is much more enjoyable and comprehensible when you know what is going on.",5,1

727649,"A quick, pleasing diversion","Curious Incident is a nice book, a quick and frothy read that I thoroughly enjoyed. My mind boggles a bit at the adulation heaped upon it, a sort of uncritical fervor last seen hyping the much less worthy Da Vinci Code.Breezily written, this book borrows some writing tricks from more substantial work. Notably, of course, is the use of a first person narrator who is ""impaired"" (in this case by autism) in a manner similar to, say, Flowers for Algernon. The use of unusual chapter numbering (prime numbers in this case), statistics problems, diagrams, and so forth is amusing in a observational kind of way. These are all tricks, though, that make you sit back a bit from the book. Oooh! Isn't that clever?In any case, the back half of the book seemed to telegraph much of the plot and I surely hope we don't get a sequel. But it is so amusing and a nice diversion from much of the drivel available today that I recommend this novel as a good, enjoyable read.",4,1

The majority of the books I have bought on the subject have been disappointing at the best.From the beginning, Book Marketing is Dead promised to deliver information I could use. Derek Murphy is an editor, cover designer, author and internet entrepreneur with a well-rounded appreciation of the publishing game. His advice comes from years of marketing experience, and trial-and-error in his own business, and was just the sort of information I was craving.He filled in the blanks left by other marketing books, instead giving me a new appreciation for the importance of my website and social platform &#8211; things I had neglected in the past, as well as ideas on how best to apply paid marketing. Now, instead of a murky, confused marketing plan, I have a to-do list I can&#8217;t wait to get started on.",5,1
585815,Charming!,"Another delightfully witty gem from Julia Quinn! This is a story of a boy and a girl growing up and coming to the realization that their friendship has turned into romantic love. It's charming and lighthearted (but not without conflict). The excellent dialogue and Quinn's pleasing writing will have you trying to bend the ear of any reader friends who happen to be nearby: ""Oh! Just listen to this for a minute!"" This isn't a hot and steamy romance; it's more a tale of the sweetness and giddiness of first love expertly told. If you're looking for titillating sex scenes, you should probably skip this one. Here, Quinn offers us a chance to share the magic as Honoria and Marcus discover that they have well & truly fallen--and what do they do now? I thoroughly enjoyed reading this, and several months later I enjoyed rereading it. (A lovely bonus for Quinn fans--Honoria's story gives us part of the infamous Smythe-Smiths' story: it's the first book of the Smythe-Smith quartet.)",5,1

So exalently played by all the characters, you will feel as if you have befriended the characters and hate the villians. The movie was brilliantly addapted from the Steven King Novel. The way this movie is presented to the audience the story unfolds to you so smoothly. The mind has no problem understanding it. If you find a mythical and Spiritual storyline intrigueing.

5628646,Rambling Away To This Hillbilly Band,"This is one super fine debut recording by the Marshall Tucker Band.  These songs are written from the heart and soul and exhibit much energy and really soothe the soul.Doug Gray is one of the true great singers in all of contemporary recorded music. Not to lnock Toy Caldwells vocals on Can't You See or Hillbilly Band.  There is plenty of passion from him. Their voices just blend in nicely with the fine instrumentation of the other band members, background vocalists, and guest artists like Charlie Daniels, Paul Hornsby, and Jaimoe.  Keyboards, saxaphones, fiddles, guitars,etc.. this record has it all.Loud and soft but basically free and easy all of these tracks are winners.  Take The Highway, Hillbilly Band, Can't You See, and My Jesus Told Me So stand out the most.  But the other tracks are almost as good.So all you southern rockers or any of those who like a little twang in your music, pick this one up real soon.",5,1

6550720,when IR won't work... this is the solution!,"I normally use IR so that I can set my flashes to TTL mode and not have to worry about balancing my lighting.  But IR is a line of sight system and doesn't work for every situation.  The Pocket Wizard is a great solution to that problem.  because it is a radio transmitter, I can put my flashes anywhere I want including around corners.  I have been using them for a few months now and they have always performed the way I want them to.  The only draw backs that I can think of, is that they are constructed out of plastic, so they feel a little cheap.  But I have dropped one before on the pavement and it survived so I think they can take some abuse.  Also you need to set your flashes to manual mode which takes a little longer to balance the lighting just right for portraits.  if you are shooting Canon (I shoot Nikon), Pocket Wizard has a set that can support TTL mode.  I am waiting for the Nikon version to come out.  but when IR doesn't do the job, there is nothing better than the Pocket Wizards!",5,1

5483985,"A clever, unique and smartly written thriller","When I saw the name  ""Einstein"" my curiosity was piqued.  The author successfully managed to take one of my favorite topics- history and then mix it nicely in with sci-fiction (time travel).That was great but then the author goes a step further and adds in mystery.  This created an unquestionable home run of a read.The characters were all very solidly created and the plot was well thought out.The story was a different one -  Jacob had a hunch that Einstein had made a deathbed confession.This hunch leads to a search and the book unfolds to tell a great story.The attention to detail and unique plot made Einstein's Secret a fun and fast read with a unique and fresh take on time travel.The way time travel was used felt so authentic that it turned the book into a realistic thriller with a fast paced energy that wouldn't let up.I will be recommending this one to several of my friends.  I think this is one that may be headed to the best seller list.Excellent read!",5,1

However, if you are inexperienced, or if you can only afford one book, do not get this one. Some of the advice was actually dangerous.  For example, many of the techniques suggested to""diffuse through empathy"" will actually backfire in a very significant way.  They can act as triggers particularly if the individual has a sensitivity about one of those issues the author suggested you be ""empathetic"" about ...Reading this made me wonder if the author has hands-on experience or if this is all theoretical case study?",1,0
8860149,REALISTIC VIEW OF DOOMSDAY,"I was so taken aback by the graphic realities of this movie, that I even purchased a very bad pirated copy off e-bay. The only compliant I have about this movie, is that it had yet to be released as a region 1 DVD. I still have the VHS tape as well. This is by far the most graphic, realistic portrail of the long term consequences of global nuclear war. There are no winners in muclear war. Everyone loses in such a war, even if it is limited. This movie should be a MUST for all the world's leaders to watch as they play chicken with their ""red buttons"" and ""footballs"". Perhaps even someone as simple minded as W can understand the consequences of these horrible weapons, and why the world should be uniting in their elimination. If you thought Testament or the Day After was graphic, that is a trip through a fantsyland compared to the realities pictured in Threads.",5,1
