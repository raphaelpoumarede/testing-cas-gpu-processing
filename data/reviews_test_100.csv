2767458,One of my favorite books!,"This book stirs up so many feelings of promise, love and regret. It's beautifully written, and I'm looking forward to other novels from this wonderful author.",5,1
2266940,By Far the Best Craft Book I have EVER seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I just got the book the otherday and I have alreadly flagged about 30 items I want to do ASAP... It's amazing...and I saw the other book same publisher &quot;365 simply handmade easy projects for every occaision....&quot;  I want to get that book too, its almost as incredible as this book!  page after page is crammed with the easiest most inspiring elegant ideas.... never seen a book so awesome... I'll be the envy of the neighborhood.... YOU'VE GOTTA BUY THIS BOOK, its probably the only craft book you'll ever need... SERIOUS!!!!  (I really really like the beaded candle idea) and about 30 other simple yet elegant items!!!  (one thing, I just wish they had some &quot;St. Patrick's Day Crafts)....",5,1
4229565,"Well Written, but long","This was a very well written book, especially the usage of the dialect throughout.  It flowed easily.  Sadly, the story just didn't grip me, ever.  I chose this book for my book club this month.  I think we all felt about the same.  Well written, but it was slow and dragged on too long.  We all wanted to know more about any truths in the book though.  What was fact?  What was fiction?  We will be seeing James McBride next year during the Portland Literary Arts lecture series.  Maybe he will talk more about the book as I think we will all find the back story more fascinating than the actual book itself.",2,0
4932630,Just Bad,Could have been good but someone told this writer that trashy insta-sex sells. If you like porn you might like this. This is an example of lazy writing. She just got jilted but she immediately wants to be with the dude in a kilt?  Really? Okay it was free.,1,0
4589942,Ishamel is older but is he wiser ?,"Our boy has become a man. In the course of the story we discover that Ishmael has gone off on a tangent, has forgotten 'The Way' and needs to find his way back to his previously centered self.Nicely told, but slightly different than the previous tales, as there are a few years between this story and the previous one. I also found it more realistic than the previous tales in that Ishmael is not perfect, and I got the impression that he is less certain of himself than in previous stories, yet he is the one now making the decisions.Real Good Story Food, read it !",5,1
7916453,Smooth and it does not bunch up,"Until I received this item free for review purposes and spent a few nights with my head on it I had never understood how accurate the phrase ""smooth as silk"" was. Heretofore, my pillowcases had always been cotton and now when I compare them the cotton seems so stiff.I have also found the silk to be less annoying that the stiffer cotton. I spend a great deal of sleeping time on my right side and the cotton on the edges of the pillowcase sometimes bunches up and tickles my nose and face, especially when I am about to fall asleep. After more than two weeks of using this silk pillowcase that has yet to happen. The pillow also feels softer overall, although I am sure that is mental rather than physical. There is a zipper so that the pillow does not slip out.When this pillowcase wears out I will no doubt be spoiled and have to purchase a new silk pillowcase to replace it as it will be too hard to go back to cotton.",5,1
678501,Warriors,"I liked this one because I have always wondered about Tallstar's past and what moor runners and things are. I thought it was a little mean of Palebird to practically ignore Tallstar when her new kits came. Other than that, I enjoyed reading it.",5,1
1336450,Engrossing,"The protagonist is very real.  His moral dilemma is engrossing and keeps the reader engaged in the story and hungry for more. I thoroughly enjoyed Red Rising, and I anxiously await the next installment of this trilogy.",4,1
2935021,better be a 3rd,Ok...Mrs White i didn't give the first book that good of a review because i didn't like how in the end Carmen just pops out of nowhere and then she is confused between him and isiah and the book ends.....BUT i have to say i am impressed with this sequeal i like the fact that Queen is more mature and grown up....it also has some twist and turns that had my mouth hanging open..i loved the end...but there BETTER be a 3rd one!..and hurry up with it......good job Mrs White.,5,1

3529475,Save money with coupons,"With the on gong financial crisis, it's a good idea if you could cut down some on your expenses especially when it comes to your groceries.  Couponing is a good way to save but how do you exactly start couponing.  If you ever wondered how people can save huge amount of money by couponing, this is the perfect book to read.  The book is teeming with tips you can use how to start couponing, how to use those coupons, how to organize, and so much more. This is a very informative book about extreme couponing without the stress.",5,1
7273490,Bought two more!,"I ordered two of these this time. I liked the one I previously ordered so much that I got one for my two kids for Christmas. So, I bought three in total. Great product, especially because it give me more TV options than I already have. I live in the country and only have DSL and Dish so my TV options are spotty at best.",5,1
1795715,Another good read,Another great Baldacci read. The new &#34;Good Guy&#34; Puller is a great operator. He is extremely resourceful under difficult circumstances.I don't think any character could be as appealling as what Oliver Stone .Puller is starting to gain his own strength. I am looking forward to his next adventure.,4,1
9390962,Crazy movie,Jack Black is a great actor and musician. He was perfect for the part of Bernie. I can ID with the small town thinking. Seems there is always a rich person in a small town and they always have their way. It is even more interesting since it is based on true story. YOU should watch this movie.,5,1
6284941,Very nice piece of luggage,"I must say I have not used it yet, because my vaction is still 2 weeks away, but I love the design the roominess, I did do a trial run with my vacation clothes becasue yes I am a clothes hoarse. I packed 12 outfits and a few pairs of shoes and they all fit so I have no doubt it will be great for my vacation.",5,1
7769188,Great!,I used to have one that came with a hot chocolate kit. Sadly it broke and I was very pleased to find this. Great price and it works great in my coffee. Just be careful in cups to not hit the bottom or sides to much otherwise I will scratch and possibly damage.,4,1
3135198,Hunting Eve,This book was all about Eve and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The only problem I have is reading it too fast and have to wait so long for the next one!,5,1
1430007,Confusing,Jumped around too much.  Never quite sure who I was reading about. Didn't get close to characters. Two self centered selfish women.,1,0
2835536,Offroad heaven!,"I absolutely LOVE this guidebook.  My family is from Idaho for many generations, and in using this guidebook, I have found quite a few of the old homestead sites listed in our family scroll.",5,1
6472708,Attractive and inexpensive product,"This small stereo system is exactly what it claims--a good small system at a good price.  Sound is solid, and although bass and treble adjustments are limited to several factory preset mixes, one of the presets seems to work well for everything from talk radio, to jazz, to classical, or rock.The product looks more expensive than it is, with a rich precision finish that is quite striking.  My only real complaint is the LCD display is quite small and hard to read when not illuminated.",4,1
2735496,Good for daily reading,"I like it for my daily reading before I start the day. I don't recommend it if your some kind of scholar or a translation buff, it's modern and therefore open to differing opinions about it. I happen to be an addict and alcoholic and I like the way the notes, insights and commentary are intertwined with the text in a way someone like me could relate to. It's practical and useful in a personal spiritual growth way. Jesus is my higher power so I am biased in my viewpoints. It's worth the money and more if your looking for a Bible thats kind of like a huge book of daily meditations for recovery and one thats easy to read and understand without a theological degree.",5,1
2849405,"Anothern fine guidebook from ""Mikey""","This book is a fine addition to numerous others by this author dealing with the Utah canyon country. He invariably is accurate and correct in his listings for various trips, both by 4WD and on foot, in these areas. True, the font is relatively tiny especially for aging eyes, but it sure allows for a lot of information in a small volume. Also, most users can forgive the occasional rants on the BLM and other organizations - they all have at least a seed of truth in them. And long ago we all got used to the term &#34;foto&#34;. If you need a dependable guide to these areas, his books have stood the test of time.",4,1
4247019,A light read with a powerful message,"This was such a fun, light book to read. The Accidental Bride is technically book two in Denise Hunters Blue Sky Romance series but you can read the books in any order. I enjoyed following Shay Brandenberger 's adventure that all begins when she is accidentally married at the Founders days wedding reenactment. The groom ended up being her high school sweetheart, Travis McCoy, that got cold feet at their wedding many years ago. It was fun watching Travis, who had never stopped loving her, convince her to take the marriage seriously and to fall in love with him all over again. What was more important about this simple, very unrealistic story was the underlying message that Denise wove into it. Shay and her daughter both start to learn the lesson that they need to serve God and not please people. What a message so many of us need and a great reminder of what is really important in this life.",4,1
1521448,A must-have on your Kindle!!!,"This is one of those &#34;spiritual classics&#34; that every Catholic must have. Every question I have regarding the Catholic faith is answered clearly and concisely. The interior format makes knowledge quickly accessible. Very well-done. I have the hardcopy, but the Kindle edition can be taken everywhere.",5,1
2602069,Paper Roses,The story kept you waiting for Clay to come to his awareness that he was in love with his brothers mail order bride. A real page turner. Who was the thief! Who had murdered his brother?,5,1

7314438,Love it!,"I have used these on my last three plane trips and love the sound quality. I use the longer ear inserts and love their ability to cancel out the noise of the airplane and allow me to hear the quality of the music or movie! Also, because of much less background noise, I do not have to play the music as loud, so my ears get a rest!",5,1
8066982,Book was hard to put down,I thought it was a very good book and I believe it has a god message to those that read and pay attention.I did not find it  boring at all and did not have to skip ahead and I really enjoyed the way the writer writes in this book.Definitely recommend it for you to read.,5,1
4370067,The Bookmark Blog for Hollywood Lies,"Cole and Devon are both Hollywood types looking for a relationship, whether they each know it or not. Hollywood gossip however prevails! It was a really interesting twist on how things go in Hollywood and see all the relationships that develop.So, wow! This was a sexy read! From the synopsis of the book I totally wasn't expecting that part of it.  But it really was a great book.  I will say that I think the same story could have been told without all the sex scenes, they seemed to put the book just a little bit over the top. That said, I loved the relationship that develops between Cole and Devon and all the ensures between the two.Steamy, Sexy and Fun!",4,1
7692352,Inexpensive and accurate,"I won't belabor the points made by other reviewers, but this scale is extremely accurate (especially for home use), and it comes with the proper calibration weights, a weighing tray, and some &#34;tweezers&#34; which I tossed.  The tare function is nice as it quickly and easily subtracts the weight of the weighing vessel.  I use it for weighing out powdered supplements.",5,1
1589638,Surprisingly good legal thriller!,"Marty Kalish is on trial for murder, and the story is told from his perspective.  In love with a married woman, Marty is the principal suspect when her husband is murdered.  At first the book dragged a bit.  Then once the trial started, it was hard to put down.  Not the best written thriller, but oh what a ride!  Very clever plot from beginning to end.  I like Marty Kalish!",4,1
6860211,All mice are not created equal,"The thing that attracted me to this mouse, was the auto-off feature. It seemed I was forever finding the mice I have used gradually working more and more when they felt like it, only to discover it was because the battery was dying because there is a constant drain on it. I could have turned it off, but who wants to have to turn on a mouse every time you pick it up.I use this mouse with a laptop and it worked on almost any surface I encountered, from a table top to my pants leg.",5,1
9180048,He can play mean,I liked this movie but it is not a family movie. Hugh really shows his ability to play mean and nasty but I'll watch Hugh no matter how he plays!!!,5,1
5073434,My kind of book!,"This is a great entertainment trilogy. I wish the second trilogy will follow soon. It is a mixture of science fiction with katanas, with parts that read like &#34;Kill Bill&#34;. If you want action with a new twist, don't miss this trilogy!",5,1
1206871,Absolutely loved it,"Fabulous read- Kate Atkinson does it again with an enthraling, beautiful book that I was genuinely sorry to get to the end of...",5,1
5675173,"Good, REALLY good.","This Cd is an Awsome attribute to any CD collection. The guitar riff's are brilliant and complement Eddies voice really well. If it is your first time buying a Pearl Jam album this one is a good start. My personal favorite is Elderly Woman Behind The Counter followed closly by Animal, Daughter, Leash, Go, Dissident and Glorified G, my worst and the album's only bad song in my eyes is W.M.A, don't ask me why but it just gets on my nerves. Other Than that a good listen from begining to end. I would actually rate it a 4.5 but can't.",5,1
6082344,Unsung Melody,"Many readers have commented on the omission of the children's chanson, ""Jamais, je ne t'oublierai,"" sung at the end of the film (I would imagine that the omission had something to do with copyright.). Although I was as disappointed as other reviewers, the CD compensates for this lack with other delights, including Lang Lang's lilting interpretation of Satie's ""Gnossienne #1"" and Mr. Desplat's haunting ""River Waltz"" which not only complements Satie's composition but also evokes the ephemeral mood of this memorable film so beautifully.Well worth having in one's CD library.",4,1
2371040,Love this series,Paul Doherty knows how to write a good series of this time period. Read them all. Thinking of trying to real Canterbury Tales....,5,1
5931789,Cheesy Cheesy Cheesy,"This album was quite cheesy, and lyrics were not great. The best song is the one they released first, which is ""Single For The Rest of my Life"", and to be honest, I think that only the lead singer is able to sing. The worst song is Unladylike, which is sung horribly. They are just another group.",1,0
8445683,"Loved the first one, devoured the second!","I was really excited to find out more about Jett, and this story certainly delivered. Daniella thinks things have finally quieted down when Jett comes storming in sexy and ripped as ever. Definitely worth a read!",5,1
7041620,Excellent with some drawbacks!!!,"Another Excellent Digital Camera from Sony.Would like to rate it at 5 Stars, but still thinking should I make it 5 stars or keep it at 4 stars.Has everything, except for 2 drawbacks. Hence 4 star, but still thought it was good.Pros:Sleek and light weight. Small buttons, but that is how the camera can be made sleek.Good Clarity.Excellent HD Video recording, thinking now, did I need a Camcorder, since I purchased both Camcorder and Camera, both are Sony.Cons:No Touch.Battery.Took 25 photos and did a 4 Min recording, battery dropped to 75%, so thinking it needs a spare battery for day long shots on trips. Need to test total number of photos. But Yes Battery is non-satisfactory.Need to charge Battery with the camera, so need to purchase an extra portable charger, since you cannot charge two batteries at the same time.Time to write to disc is bit slow, so you need to wait 20-30 Secs till you take the next snap.I have a Sandisk Extreme class 10 memory card).",4,1
1126243,Very good author,I have enjoyed all of Beaton's books.  Agatha is someone you would love or be terribly anoyed with.  Beaton writes wonderful stories with great people.,5,1
5518635,Reasonable Doubt,"What amazing sexy story. I enjoyed reading this book. This book was beyond amazing. The book was written as described, Sex and more sexual, Can't wait to read more of this author's books",5,1
2348425,THE WOMEN OF PRIMROSE CREEK(OMNIBUS),HAVING ALL 3 BOOKS IN ONE WAS REALLY NICE.  I DID FIND THERE WAS ONE MORE AND BOUGHT IT TOO.  IT SORT OF PULLED EVERYTHING TOGETHER WITH A FUTURE INTO THE MIX.  LINDA LAEL MILLER IS FUN AND POSITIVE.,5,1
5934376,Extraordinary.,"Who said Joe would run out music? Save that for Metallica and Steve Vai because Strange Beautiful Music will give you a good night's sleep. Joe has painted this album with a lot of rock and soothing melodies. Its one of those albums that stays in shape for infinity. Back with his old bass player Matt, Joe drives this in full speed with blazing solos and at other times slows down like a little stream. Compared to his older albums, this one has a more traditional rock (Sorry, not Led Zeppelin, The Who or some dinosaur kind of rock) feel with a peaceful freshness to it. So if you think he's one of those classic rock wannabe guitarists (like SRV), prove yourself wrong and listen to this album.Highlight in the album: Starry Night",5,1
7079479,Balanced sound and light weight,These earphones are the best compared to Shure and Sennheiser and won't hurt your monthly budget.It has full detail sound compared to Shure 210 (lack of base ..good for classic songs)& Sennheiser CX300 (no mids and lows ..good for Hiphop).These earphones delivers natural sound.Regarding the durabulity ..These earphones are not good listening music while sleep.,4,1
3416545,The jerusalem inception,loads of suspense... lots of twists and turns.... loving everything i read by this author cannot wait to read the sequel!!Highly recommend this book. very well written!,5,1
8296169,Save,"This book was so powerful. Domestic violence is very prevalent in my state and as an ER RN, I see too much of it. This book takes your run of the mill rocker romance and then jacks the volume up to 30! Putting difficult and painful issues in with these types of books just makes them seem real...and I like real. I also like the immediate chemistry and how they don't fight it but grow with it. Good book!Recommend- YESHEAT-4/5Re-read- before the next one comes out.",5,1
2949831,Kept me on the edge,"I love this book. The plot is phenomenal, I like the way you drew me as a reader into it. Human psyche has always been an area of my interest and I just couldn't put it down. I read it in a few hours, trying to read faster and fasted to get to the end because I just couldn't wait to see what you did with the characters. One of my favorite movies are Shutter Island and Inception and your book would make a great 3rd movie up that alley. I will definitely recommend (already did) this to my friends and am curious to see what you've done with your other books. As soon as I get some free time, I'm buying another one of your books :)",5,1
5718703,Epic Masterpiece,"Prince's double album Sign of the Times is pure brillance. This is probably one of my favorite double albums ever. The only track that I don't really care for is Track 3 on disc one Housequake. But the rest of the album is not filler. The songs are probably Prince's most artistic he ever written. Favorites include Sign 'O' the Times, Play in the Sunshine, Ballad of Dorothy Parker, Starfish and Coffee, Slow Love, Forever in My Life, U Got the Look, If I Was Your Girlfriend, I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man, The Cross, and Adore. Highly Highly Recommended.",5,1
4505742,Wonderful Overview,This book is a great resource for anyone who wants to dive into Morrigan-centric celtic mythology. It was a wonderful jumping off point for my own research.,4,1
4723331,For Novice Divers,"What a great read, a mix of what it is like to be a dive instructor, an expat Englishman living in Egypt (the Sinai).  As a confident and experienced diver the exploits of being a dive instructor were humorous as yes I could relate.  The dive stories were fantastic, having dived the Sinai, but not Sharm as to touristy and dived out (100 people plus on one site), but a great insight to what it is like.  I liked it how John was able to convey the troubles of the region and how he as an expat related to what was going on.  Well written and inspired me to read his second book, which was equally good.",4,1
2055006,Fantastic,Interesting in that to some degree close to the Iron Druid Chronicles which is also quite a compelling series. But this has its own flavor. Storytelling in that classic fashion where on waits for each character to reveal his or her own own history. Rich in description....love the physics element introduced to explain the unexplainable...,5,1
1509982,Perfect,"I love Mark Bittman, but he's topped himself with this book. It gives me everything I want....a new eating plan, a lot of great vegan and flexible recipes, and a good reference section on food. Kudos to Bittman for a perfect cookbook.",5,1
4245065,Totally unexpected,"SAVING CICADAS completely surprised me. Seemingly a story about a single mother, her parents, and two daughters, all off on a family car trip to the unknown. Or is it? This story is proof that you should never ""assume"" you know where a story is going. This book starts in one place and, once you're so sure where the story is going, picks you up and puts you in a completely different place. You are three-quarters through the book before you actually realize what the story is about - all the while completely enjoying the sweet little family car trip story. I can't imagine anyone reading this book and not being surprised where the journey takes you. Lovable characters, realistic story, part mystery and part.... surprise party is the only way I can describe it. I'm not sure I've ever read a book that snuck up on me like this one did. I honestly didn't see the ""twist"" to the story coming.Very unique, very enjoyable, highly recommended.",4,1
1875754,Awesome book that closed many strings...,"However left enough out there to want more from Simon R. Green...really have enjoyed seeing this series develop and since I stayed up until after midnight to finish it on a, ""school"" night...hope you all enjoy it as much as I did....and having my very own Molly Metcalf that regularly busts my balls I resonate a bit with the author...great read and am looking forward to next...",5,1
4162044,Great patterns,"I thumbed through this book while at the bookstore, and I have to say, it looks way better in person than the few photographs here on amazon seem to show. The book has a lot of really great patterns, and is much more colorful and varied on the inside. The book is divided into sections that take their inspiration from things from nature, and not just your ususal, earth, water, fire, routine. The book includes some great designs, and the photographs are really beautiful. I would definitely recommend getting this book, and will picking up one for myself soon!",5,1
2358097,Timley and Thought-Provoking,"I can't think of a better compliment than to say this ""ripped from the zeitgeist"" exploration of the death penalty and belief. Who would the Messiah appear as if he were to return? That is the question.",4,1
7677897,Quiet Operation,This unit which is smaller than I'm used to provides excellent heat. When turned on the operation is quietand heats up a medium size room quickly. It has the choice of oscillating or standing still which I reallylike. This unit turns off automatically when the room reaches the temperature you have selected. It turnson again when the temperature drops.I like this because it can help you save on your electricity bill.It has 2 settings to choose from one 750 watts (low) 1500 watts (high) I'm very happy with this purchase.,5,1
6135031,Great heavy mellow album,"I was pleasantly surprised to find this album - a heavy two piece (bass, drums) that mixes in eastern instruments (sitar). Great sounding, spacey without a navel gazer. Best way to explain it would be if Lemmy and Pink Floyd had a baby.",4,1

7516160,"Picture skewed, USB didn't work, got lots of channels","This seemed like a simple DVR to use with an antenna.  It was easy to set up, and it got more channels than my previous tuner.  However, the picture was always stretched, even after fiddling with the aspect ratio and other view settings.  I have an older TV (the big fat tube kind).However, my main problem with it is that I mainly wanted it to be a DVR with time shift and to record the occasional program.  I tried several different hard drives, formatted as both NTFS and FAT32, USB keys, etc., and the box didn't recognize any of them. I'm returning it and trying for a different one.",2,0

I have purchased this album many times over, on vinyl, cassette, and CD, to give away as gifts.  I don't know how to describe this one, except to quote a review I remember from People magazine in 1987: &quot;the definition of cool.&quot;  It's cool, in an oh so hot way.  The cool of jazz, the fiery passion of brazilians stylings, from this skinny little Polish lass with the biiig voice.  I've yet to encounter an album that touches me like this one.",5,1
1208459,Review of 'The Killing Moon' by N. K. Jemisin,"N. K. Jemisin's 'The Killing Moon' challenges a number of fantasy conventions. Her world is fully fleshed, with complicated political, cultural and social structures. She conveys the complexity and strangeness of her world through language, which can be confusing at times. But by the end of the book, I had achieved fluency in Jimisin's language and enjoyed seeing all of the well-plotted pieces falling into place.Read the full review at [...]Matt HlinakAuthor of [...]",4,1
3154412,loss,"If you live in Pennsylvania, you've surely heard of the Marcellus Shale -- and you're more than likely aware of how contentious and controversial it is, from the damage that drilling may be doing to whether, and how much, the state should tax natural gas companies.  But few know what it's really like, on the ground in northeastern Pennsylvania.  Seamus McGraw takes readers into the region I've heard at least one person refer to as being like the Wild West, so crazy and chaotic and apparently lawless is it.  He gets to the heart of the matter:  the people at the core of this (or any) story.  Through them, he explores all dimensions of the Marcellus Shale, highlighting the lesson to beware the costs and losses that attend almost every ostensible benefit.  Sometimes, perhaps most of the time, despite all the gain (here, financial boons, increased supply of natural gas), you can't get back what was lost.",4,1
4306551,Leave the bounty hunter character to Bradshaw,"At least do a ride along, talk to the people who have experience in the things you are writing about.  Do more than just computer research before you attempt to write a book.  This book reads like a college term paper.  The author shows potential, but probably should get some real life experience before attempting another book.Sorry, I can't recommend this book.",2,0
8869306,Exciting full of action and moving!,"This is the best movie of the saga of the Highlander. I saw it with many reserves because I've read many negative reviews but when I finally watched both versions of the DVD (on the same night) I was left with a satisfying and positive feeling. Adrian Paul was excellent, ""Kate"" (Lisa Barbuscia) is the best feminine character ever (in my humble opinion she is better than ""Amanda"" even) It was great to have those brief cameos by ""Methos"" and ""Joe Dawson"". Kell was a very ""good"" villain. My only complaint is that the make up department couldn't achieve a younger look for Christopher Lambert. This movie captures the same feeling and magic of the TV series. Kudos for the producers of this great movie!.",5,1
7993489,Love this series,After reading Broken I had to read this series from Alec's point of view and I was not disappointed. This is very well written and I love the fact that this book answers a lot of questions I had after reading Broken. The author ties the books together nicely without boring you with to much repetitions. I also have to say that I loved that it brought out more details with the scene at the end. I'm off to read the sequel 'Splintered' but I think this is a must read for everyone.....5 Stars Hands Down!!!!!!!!,5,1

The previous characters flow in and out of the story, but you fall in love with the protagonist every time. The characters are rich, the author paints such a wonder picture for your mind, it's like an award winning movie to ingest the words.

Have to wear low enough on ear not to get painful pressure where my eyeglasses go over my ears. I experience this with all head phones. Sound quality is petty good out of the box. May get better. Wore for 8 hours straight and battery still going and no discomfort. Only con, tendency to slip forward or backward off my head. And I wear a large hat size, so I don't know how they could be THAT loose. Be neat if there was a way to tighten or loosen any kind of head phone, not just extend ear pieces down. If they somehow ""stretch out"" they will become a problem.",4,1

I used a lot of different combinations of cakes and icing ... one good one was DH Spice and I added chopped nuts and raisins and just sprinkled powdered sugar on top, which really shows off details in the cake. I liked it better than the Ginger Bread House one as it has more detail and trees.  Enjoy!",5,1

I agree with other reviewers who called the book hard to put down and chilling. If you love suspense, you'll quickly find yourself wrapped up in this book. Even if it's not a book you would normally pick up, I highly recommend giving it a try. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.",5,1

I was so pleased with this book when I received it in the mail. The pages are nice and thick, the illustrations and photographs are beautiful, and the tear-out trading cards are a sure hit with kids. Also, the fact that it is an American Girl book makes it all the more appealing to girls. It's worth mentioning that the book is small in size - about 8in X 6in but I don't think that it deters from the quality of the book. Overall, I'm very happy with this book and reccomend it for any little girl.",5,1

4299406,A Preacher Overcoming the Mess But Still Living With The Repercussions,"OK. A Preacher cheats on his wife. Yes, you have heard that story before. Perhaps you have seen it in your own church. As an ordained minister, I must say that this scenario is all to common.But the book is more than simply a ""he cheated on her and she loved him through it and now they live happily ever after"" kind of story. In this novel, we see JT (Mr. Preacher) and his reckless behavior having real consequences on his relationships and his church.I liked how the author had the preacher-man pay for his indiscretions even though he was growing in his relationship with God. Yes, getting straight with God doesn't eliminate the repurcussions of your actions. The ending held in tension living with the consequences and living in hope.I would have liked to see how the author would have dealt with some in church preaching. We heard about it, but let's see if JT can bring it...lol, but hey that's just me.The author grabed me in the beginning and kept me on board. I will read the next book in the series...",4,1

This Gifset is the best thing we fans can ask for. With the sharp restoration and bonus material that is a true treasure, this is a no-brainer purchase. These movies are, in my opinion, the finest that Hollywood had ever created and films nowadays should learn a little from this in order to deliver better products instead of the crap that most of them are.",5,1

7991194,Informative and motivational,"There are two alternatives man faces because he IS -- the choice between unconquerable hopelessness and meaninglessness in and of life, or a religious/spiritual one through an adoption of faith and works along with faith (for faith without works is dead). For those who choose the latter alternative, Creeden's cogent writing can help motivate God's children back to Him where they've strayed or become prodigals. She clearly shows through scriptural authorities that judging ourselves ""as not so bad"" is not good enough if God's children are to truly return to Him. There is a wealth of information here that informs and instructs on this interesting Christian subject of the Prodigal Life. The writing is readable and authoritative and one gets a sense that the author has done her research with diligence and honesty in being able to put across her points with such admirable force.",4,1

I liked the attention paid to writing as work; both these women were practical and persevered, although we also get to see moments of ease and celebration. The contrasts between where they went and what they did is fascinating, with the focus on Rose's wanderings, of course. Lovely to see this talented woman get the center stage here!",5,1

She had a baby and Devon left not even a good 10 seconds after she had the baby. He left her because of the weight gain she toremented herself for it. She cried several years before she finally built up enough courage to basically say if you want to leave then I will hold the damn door open for you! I just loved it. I think Ms Anna Black is making her way on my favorite authors list. Keep it up Ms Black. Lastly, I can't say I hope Devon finds love. I hope he stay stuck on Lelia the rest of his life (in Book 1 & 2, or 3 if any) because he hurt her so much; and that is karma coming back around.",5,1

3402604,A whirlwind of adventure from first page to last!,"John Lyman know's how to tell a story! In God's Lions he takes a real discovery from 30 years ago, throws in a Catholic priest, adds a dash of divine intervention and then puts it in the oven and lets it bake for 30 minutes. The result is a story that can be enjoyed by the most demanding of reader, while still appreciated by those rare few still looking for entertainment that doesn't include swearing or sex. In John's own words ""God's Lions"" is the type of series that you can leave on the table for your 13 year old son to pick up without your heart skipping a beat. But don't even think about leaving it on the table, because if you do your will certainly be fighting someone over the book sooner or later.I recommend God's Lions. It was well written and enjoyable. I give it a solid 4.5 stars!",5,1
6169066,Maturity,"There's no need to say anymore about this album than anyone else has. Drake has a more mature sound in this album and you can tell that he's growing as an artist. The production is great and the lyrical content is great. Not all 17 tracks are on point, but Lord Knows, Underground kings, Make Me Proud, The Real Her, Take Care, Over My Dead Body, and Look What you've Done more than make up for the mediocre (not bad at all) songs on the album. This is a must have album for 2011. Caution, though, if you don't like Drake singing, then you may want to preview the album first. He has a couple of R&Besque songs. Overall, I stand by my opinion of a must have album of 2011.",5,1

The script was full of stupid cliches and the dialog is not realistic.  The characters themselves are boring and in a drama that RUINS it - the appeal of a drama is complicated nd multi-dimensional characters.  I guarantee the better ratings are from people too turned on by Leo (hard to plame them) to give a realistic rating!

5272429,When does the movie come out?,"This book has a little bit of everything. Despite what another poster said I think it does quite well at keeping the action tantalisingly off screen (page?). There is something cinematic about the writing style at points then it all melts away as you get caught up in the dialogue. I think it would translate very well to the screen. I noticed a few typos but not any more than I would in any other book (even professionally published), I hope they will be fixed in a future edition. It ended too quickly for me, I wanted more. I'm not sure my blood pressure could handle another book like this but God I hope he writes one.",5,1

And that is my biggest complaint - that each battle coverage is too short. Yet given their time constraints, they do an excellent job. The weakest point is that some of their modern explorations of the past equipment and experiences are a bit superficial - the tacking against the wind, for instance. But these are only a small proportion of the total time spent. My biggest wish is that each segment had been twice as long. It's very good stuff!",4,1

5811955,A masterful performance by a master,"Bedrich Smetana wrote a cycle of six symphonic poems called Ma Vlast (My Country) during the late Nineteenth Century.  One of the pieces, The Vltava (The Moldau) is very well known and gets included in many albums of music by Czech composers (e.g., Smetana, Dvorak, and Janacek).  The other five pieces are less well known, but together they make up a wonderful piece of music.  It is hard to believe that Smetana was going deaf while he was composing them.Rafael Kubelik was a great Czech musician and conductor who left his country in 1948, when the Communists overthrew the democratic government, and he vowed never to return until things improved.  He finally went home in 1990 when democracy was restored.This CD features a great orchestral work performed by the Czech Philharmonic, conducted by a great director at the 1990 Prague Spring Festival.  It is a masterful performance.",5,1
5711342,Ride The Train,"The Captain & Me finds the Doobie Brothers perfecting their unique sound.  The most famous track off the album is the classic ""China Grove"".  The song kicks off with an instantly recognizable guitar riff and then moves swiftly through to a beautifully harmonized chorus.  While not as famous as ""China Grove"", ""Long Train Runnin'"" actually charted higher and became the band's first top ten hit.  The song peaked at number 8, while ""China Grove"" stalled at number 15.  """"Long Train Runnin'"" also has a great guitar riff and is longer than the more concise ""China Grove"".  These two songs are the album's obvious standouts, but aren't the only things the album has to offer.  ""Natural Thing"", ""Without You"", ""Clear As The Driven Snow"" and the title track are all strong tracks.  The album itself was also their first top ten album, peaking at number 7, and started a streak of 8 consecutive top ten releases.",4,1
9296212,What a great show!!,"This is a fantastic live performance of the Keith Emerson Band. I'm really glad I picked it up. Emerson can still play, though not quite has amazingly fast as he did in his heyday. Amazon has the CD running time of 70 minutes, but the DVD is actually much longer. Nearly 2 hours. Emerson can still play and really seemed to be enjoying himself, interacting with the audiance. Marc Bonilla's guitar work adds to the ELP classics, giving those selection a slightly different vibe. Many of the ELP songs have been extended. Lucky Man runs more than 10 minutes, while Tarkus clocks in at a lenghty 36 minutes. Tarkus, as an example, has several places in the middle that are different and yet intriguing, including a nice drum solo. More improvisational playing. Emerson's newer and less well known pieces typically run 1-2 minutes long. I am very pleased with this purchase.",5,1
4189055,Shockingly great!,"Well I guess I wouldn't say I was ""shocked"" by how much I liked this book, but it was pleasantly exciting with its unexpected plot twists and fluid writing style.

It was a good read, plus I felt like I was on the front lines with the women soldiers and sailors the author interviewed for the book.  This book was originally a Master's thesis, and it reads more like a thesis than a book.  The author rarely interjected her own political opinions, but stuck to her premise that she admired these women and wanted to know more about them, and to tell their stories.  I appreciated this.  The book is more than non-fiction; it's very factual.  I finished reading with as great a sense of amazement and as much respect and admiration as the author said she developed while researching the book.  We back here at home have NO IDEA what our soldiers and sailors in combat zones are experiencing, and I think we should.  Thanks to the author for putting it all on paper.",4,1

It's so strange and yet cathartic to sing what died so long ago. I don't need no stinkin hooks and silly loops. This is the best C-rock can be ...real life and how to carry on.  This is my favorite RK disc for this reason alone. The Boss watching over us as we fail so mightily and devastatingly.  The challenge is getting up again and ultimately loving again.  This is the first CD in years that I could really hammer into my head for weeks and still find meaning and emotion. I like the previous RK offerings but compared to this they are somewhat detached. This is the first RK that I put on the level of Switchfoot and Jars.  I've been blessed and ministered to with hard riffs and bashing drum kit and keyboards to die for...yeah thanks guys, I've been in the wars too and I learned to love deeper and better.

I also was VERY glad that there wasn't a repeat of the Blake/Rowan saga! I was just waiting for her to throw her hat in the ring there for a few minutes.",5,1
7909445,Works Well And Really Comes In Handy,I have more pans in my kitchen than tops for them so this lid that fits three different sizes really comes in handy.  I have used it with my 9 and a half inch sauce pan as well as my eleven inch skillet several times and it works well.  The handle is ergonomically friendly and easy to use.  Supposedly this lid is dishwasher safe but hand washing is recommended so I am taking the short amount of time it takes to clean it in the kitchen sink. At under $20 it is fairly priced.  This is one of those products that I really didn't know how much I would use and appreciate until I received it. PS The lid to my crock pot somehow came up missing and fortunately I found this lid works perfectly with it.,4,1

I've made raw desserts, bean burger, soups, sauces and smoothies and everything has turned out amazing.  With my regular blender there was always bits of veggies in my soups that weren't completely pureed and I couldn't make all the raw desserts I wanted to because I knew Id never get the right texture in my regular blender.

But thats about it. Everything else on the album plain sucks. Ciara is a highly limited artist who can barely sing..... they should've included her current hits ""Lose Control"" with Missy & Fatman Scoop , and ""Like You"" with Bow Wow on a special edition of this CD.

Tied up with a mystical 14th century cult, Jelak fancies himself some sort of god-like man, needing ""kills"" in order to complete his ""resurrection."" He sets his sites on Eve because he believes strong women like her enhance his powers.While a bit of a departure from Johansen's other novels, it's an entertaining and interesting diversion for anyone interested in vampiric thrillers.",4,1

In my experience with a Kindle Fire, I find AC charging to be must faster than USB charging. Also, charging and reading at the same time is easier with a AC model. You can charge just about anywhere that has a power outlet.As much as I read, I feel additional chargers are something I will use. If I had known exactly what it was, I would not have ordered it.

The first half is necessary to evolve the characters and explain how they all come together.  But it was not much description without evolving the story enough.  I didn't feel fully committed until about 60% in.  The author did a good job linking the various characters.  Each story was interesting.  The writing was done very well.

Throw in a bunch of misguided dragons and demons (on both sides of the fray) and you have the makings of a great story. There is so much I could say about this one but I don't want to spoil the story for the rest of you. I will say that the world that she creates is vivid and the characters have distinctive personalities that enrich the story. You can feel the pain of each character and understand what drives them to carry on despite seemingly insurmountable odds. It is a great start to a series that shows real promise.

At first I thought 'hey, what do I need another USB cord for?'...Well, it does come in handy because I just keep one of them hooked to my computer all the time and I take the other one with me for convenient, away from computer, charging.  That way the one is always where I need it when I want to download more music and the other one is always ready for charging away from my computer.I got a full charge in less than 2 hours with the adapter.

The protagonist was a psychopathic slime-ball for whom it was impossible to have any empathy - and the fact that the author clearly tried to create some for him from page one was disgusting.3. Neither the author nor the protagonist seem to have an iota of respect for anyone or anything. Religious faith, persons of authority, long-standing institutions of learning and science - not even other people at an individual level.I have no idea how such an intrinsically fascinating storyline - the real life theft of priceless moon rocks from NASA by a handful of kids - turned into such an abhorrent book, but I strongly recommend skipping this at all costs.",1,0

Instead, as I had done with Robin Hobb's excellent ""Fool's Errand"", I had hoped to read the first book from the new series and then, while awaiting book 2, read the first (2) series.Unfortunately, for me, that will not occur.  Nor will a sojourn into book two (through a purported four) of this series.I found the primary protagonist (Lianden) unempathetic (perhaps even pathetic) and, worse, the author's general writing ponderous and... lacking.I, admittedly, can't attest to how this book stacks up to its predecessors.

The story is moving, sad, heavy; perfect for someone who loves drama (like me).The story cites the Safe Haven law. There's a discussion at the end of the book on the law's enactment in all fifty states.  It poses the question:  Does it encourage irresponsible pregnancy or does it save lives?

I read Southern Fried Sushi first , then  bought Sweet Potato pie and now I finished this &#34;Til Grits Do Us Part&#34;. I have laughed, I cried and I could not put it down. There is so much in this book it is hard to believe it is not on the best seller's list. I so recommend this book, but get all three, because you need to read them all. Excellent read.",5,1

7722430,My favorite closet hangers,"The bits of rubber on these hangers means no more slipping blouses and nitey straps while hanging in the closet. I was expecting less quality (the norm today, it seems) but no, they're substantial without being heavy. I'm ordering more. The size is right for about all of my clothing excepting coats and so forth. It's hard to see but there is a convenience hook just under the top portion of the hanger, under the closet rod hook...a very useful touch. These are excellent hangers.",5,1

6049321,Jane's Addiction - 'Up From The Catacombs: The Best Of Jane's Addiction' (Rhino),"A must-have collection of the best of Jane's Addiction's repertoire {although, as far as I'm concerned all their material is great}. They're like the 'kings of alternative hard rock'. Never could get enough of Perry Farrell and crew. Can't express just how much I got out of each and every track like ""Stop!"", ""Ain't No Right"", the dramatic ""Had A Dad"", Mtv's cult hit ""Been Caught Stealing"", their more recent ""Just Because"", ""Pigs In Zen"" and the live version of ""Jane Says"".

5108331,Kent Harbinger is an Enigma...,"I enjoyed this collection.  Carolyn lets you get just close enough to Kent to be intrigued, but never quite lets you see the real him.  It ultimately ends up making you want more.  The story lines are extremely interesting but allow for quick gratification. This is a wonderful read at a great price.  After reading this collection, I read the Darc Murders collection.  Another good read that I highly recommend although it takes a while to come around to Darc after reading about Kent, but you will.  I am now reading the McCray Horror Collection and so far... LOVE IT.",4,1
3744164,Not a Sweet Romance,"I wish I could say this whole romance was a sweet romance. It comes so close. The characters are warm and inviting. Their love develops slowly. The setting is lovely. The background story is moving. However, the very explicit sex scenes made the novel almost pornographic. I am sorry to be so blunt, but I was shocked when the scenes continued until I was too embarrassed to finish them and had to skip to the next scene. I know sex sells, but so does sweet love. I understand couples in love succumbing to their sexual need, but there has to be something left to the imagination. Too bad what could have been a wonderful love story was ruined by two scenes.",4,1

8579874,Nightmare on Elm Street,"Very scary movie that first introduced us to the skillful guy who kills you in your dreams, Freddy Kreuger. This movie was the film that launched many stars' careers, including Johnny Depp who does an excellent job here. The script is written for absolute maximum suspense and terror. The killings were very original and neat, although many of them were quite graphic. However, the graphic violence is something that perhaps made the film what it was - a fright film that wants to scare you as bad as it can, and for the most part it suceeds. Like alot of people have said, this and NEW NIGHTMARE were pretty much the only decent films in the series.",5,1

Within these pages you will find a step by step daily routine which will help you tap into and develop your creative potential.Something that I personally took away from this book was the way the techniques help the reader overcome procrastination. The fashion in which Jaime suggests you examine and consider your goals is sure to wake up latent passion. Both hard work and conviction are almost unavoidable by products of this process.Do yourself a favour and get this book! When you do I implore you to put the techniques into daily practice. You will be focused, have greater relaxation and have heightened excitement to pursue and achieve your goals.",5,1

1364169,"The good, the better, and the terrible","As a Mercedes Lackey fan (who's never read any of her series works), I picked up this book with the hope of finding some new author to read.The Lackey story is quite good - an Arthurian-type tale which has a stronger Gwen than most.The Asaro story is also quite good, though I wished that it could be longer. The plot and characters needed more time to be fully developed.The Lee story is wasted space. I had to brush my teeth after reading it; it was such tripe that it left a bad taste in my mouth. The story is completely implausible, even given my proclivity for alternative fiction. The characters are almost one-dimensional, though there is one twist that was unexpected. Mostly, it was a waste of my valuable reading time.That story pulled down the collection, for me. But the other two are worth reading. From the library.(*)>",2,0

We like to hang out In The Mall And Check Out Fancy Toys, But Most of All We Want To Say, GIRLS LIKE BOYZ! WOO!&quot; are some of the lyrics. If you like fast songs, buy Myra. 10 songs are fast.

8853160,Morgan Freeman fan,This is classic Morgan Freeman.  It came out after Kiss the Girls and it's the same character but the story is completely different.  It isn't a sequel.  The plot takes a few twists and turns.  The story moves at a good pace so doesn't leave you yawning.  And when the movie was finished it left me wanting another movie with his same character played by him.  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good suspense story.,5,1

True love comes to some people in a first glance, or a first kiss, or by letters and probably many other ways.  Sometimes we have to give love a chance, and this is a very entertaining story in which one woman is conflicted with wants as opposed to what she believes is a sure thing.

It really had it all, suspense, mystery, and a bit of romance thrown in.  Saint was an interesting character, really a chameleon of sorts.  His occupation was a total shock to me, I didn't see that one coming a mile away.  He and Olivia worked well together, I just wish there was more of them together.  The ending had me immediately looking for a book 2 because we are sort of left hanging at the end of this one, so I am definitely hoping the author continues this storyline because it was really a good one.",4,1

Palmieri always creates books that enlighten and initiate reflection.  This book is no different.  You will enjoy relating to his Mom's words, as I know my Mom said a lot of the same things.

1749426,Just Filler,"&lt;Spoiler Alert> Plot elements may be discussed. This author also writes the excellent Lost Fleet series, but under a different name - Jack Campbell. Lost Fleet deals with space naval battles and emphasizes fleet manuevers, whereas the Stark series is viewed from an individual soldier's perspective at squad level. At least to start with in the first book. After initiating a rebellion and assuming command of the lunar base, the grunt now discovers that being in charge is not easy. This book is long on self-doubt, unpreparedness to counter enemy aggressions, and a bit short on action. There were just a couple of action sequences surrounded by a lot of dialogue. As I am nearly done with the third book in this series, you could almost skip this second and proceed direct to the third and not miss much. Overall, a bit slow and the stumbling style of the lead character is a bit tiresome.",2,0

1701605,Good But Not Perfect,"I like mystery novels.  Novels by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child.  I saw these Jack Reacher novels next to Lincoln Child's works in the bookstore, and made a gamble.  About 8 months later, I'm glad I made that gamble.  These books are good, easy to read, and they can get addicting.  The only thing that's keeping me from giving these five stars are the endings.  For some reason, I never feel like things were quite summed up well enough.  Perhaps I prefer a book with a detailed d&eacute;nouement.  These books provide a story that will slowly suck you in, then keep you up all night one night, and leave you wondering ""what if"" and ""what happens next?"" after.  Overall, great books, just missing something that is hard to put into words.",4,1

He has paid his penalty.  That said...PETE ROSE  An American Dilemma by Kostya Kennedy is a very fine effort, a short history of Pete Rose that covers his life without dwelling at any phase too long.  It is easy to read and filled with great insight.  Like another reviewer said, I read the book in one day.  Interesting.  Rose indeed is a dilemma, controversial and usually sets off arguments.  Read this book, get the facts, then argue better whatever side you are on.  There are a lot of books  out there on Rose, this is one of the better ones.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",5,1

She has one friend and spends most of her time alone in the huge pipe system of the inside.Inside Out is a book that explores friendship and trust in a society that values and encourages isolationism.  How does one trust when the rewards for ratting someone out are so high?The book starts slowly but becomes more engaging as it moves on.  There wasn't much romance in the story which surprised me with this being a Harlequin novel.  It is more sci-fi than most dystopian novels but it's ultimately a book about trust.There's not anything in this novel that would irritate parents.  The violence is minimal, there's one scene that involves drinking and there is no sex.",4,1

6264542,Business Casual Socks - not too thin and not too thick,I like these socks - they fill a void for business casual dress.  They are not thin like what you wear when you are in a suit and they are not thick like the kind you wear with your dockers.  They are comfortable but give a bit of a dressy appearance.  Its like a the middle ground between your worsted wool suit and your 501s; in other words like your good kakis.  If you want very comfortable socks that you want to wear with sneakers these are not for you; if you want dress socks these likely won't work for you.  But if you are looking for socks that look good yet still have a casual feel to them - these are for you.  Reason for 4 stars - I save 5 stars for something that knocks my socks off - this product put my socks on.,4,1

2040299,Another Good Book from Kay Kenyon,"Kay Kenyon has established a reputation among science fiction writers for her ability to create ""other worlds"" that is well deserved. Less often mentioned, is her skill at developing the secondary characters in her works and how well she incorporates them into the plots. Braided World is loaded with intrigue at many levels as over a dozen characters deal with the issues of personal power, changing societies, duty, loyalty, and tolerance. The remarkable part of the novel is how clearly it depicts these issues without getting bogged down or becoming confusing. Although the book is founded on the scenario described in Kenyon's prior novel, Maximum Ice, the characters and setting are completely different. If you are getting bored with science fiction that features mostly a lot of whiz-bang and golly-gee, and want to read something that is exciting but a bit more literary, The Braided World is highly recommended.",5,1
5643050,Will Downing is a master crooner.,"By itself, Will's ultra-smooth, melancholic and jazzy rendition of ""Stella By Starlight"" is a true vocal masterpiece from one of today's best but most underexposed crooners. ""Moods"" is a gorgeous CD on which Will's growth as a singer/songwriter continues smoothly. Other standout numbers include ""Sorry, I"", ""Don't Wait For Love"" and ""Where Is Love?"". Only ""Just Hold On"" (a slightly-overproduced beat ballad) sounds out of place with the CD's other tracks. Will Downing deserves to be a major superstar--he is most certainly one of today's best crooners.",4,1
4082311,A Delight to walk down memory lane,I purchased copies of this for myself and 3 sisters as our dad was a Pastor of Swedish descent.  We moved often- ranging from Minnesota to Chicago to small towns within Illinois.  We had one brother.  There were alot of connections to Margaret Jensen's story and it was a delight to be reminded of our own growing up.,5,1
4238083,Another winner from Kallmaker,"Kallmaker's latest book is another great read.Ani is an Alaskan, a budding glacial geologist, who has relocated to Key West due to her self-imposed exile.  Yes, of course, she is running away!  What is good lesbian fiction if a character isn't running away from something or someone?  And yes, Ani left too many things unresolved when she fled Alaska three years previously.  This leaves the door open for her to return to Alaska to tie up those loose ends, especially the ones involving Eve.  And those ends are tied up very neatly, in Kallmaker fashion.Populated with a wonderful cast of supporting characters (Lisa, Tonk, and Tan), this novel is the latest in the line of wonderful Kallmaker books.Well worth your time, so dive in.  Who would've thought that glacial geology was so fascinating??",4,1
8947585,OMG!  They killed Cuddles!  And Giggles!  And Petunia!,"This sick, twisted stuff is right up my alley!  I was somewhat infamous at my high school for drawing stick men having similarmisadventures, so a few of my old classmates might think I was part of the genius behind the Happy Tree Friends.  I was not, but it does my heart good to see someone cashing in on this insanity!  Handy (who has no hands) really cracks me up because you'll just miss seeing him doing impossible things like building a treehouse or bowling, but now that you are watching him, all of a sudden he's helpless to save himself or his friends from their horrible fate!Watching this DVD is kinda like watching a medley of Kenny's deaths on South Park.  The ones with Flippy the crazed Vietnam vet even have a slasher movie type feel to them.Yes, indeed , do NOT buy this DVD for young kids.  It could be very traumatic.  Let them learn on their own what a sick world it is before adding to the distress.",5,1
3320366,Excellent Book,"This book is a much needed addition to the plethora of books on Christianity that just do not deal with disability.  There is definitely a need for more church programs to deal with disability and the understanding that we need to totally embrace our own/others brokenness in order to move forward.  Only then can we provide hope and vision and a shift in cultural perception.  Even with ADA, the way disabilities are handled in the workplace, for example, is often a joke.  As an HR person for over 20 years, I know this to be true.This book should be a ""must-read"" for every church.  Highly recommended.",5,1

I just created a new partition for the whole disk and formatted it (32 bit Windows 7).I had purchased a 2TB LaCie drive that worked for a year or so and then it started making funny noises. Since I use this external drive for backup, I decided it was time to find something better.There aren't that many 2TB eSATA drives out there.

Lots of simple to follow ideas and I don't even have to follow someone else's idea of how my daily food intake should be structured. I hate those diet books that are more like a regimental business plan, it's so nice to read one that assumes you have the intelligence and are capable of putting the elements together without step by step guidance.Nice share, thanks.",5,1

4707342,Vivid action and likeable characters,"I enjoyed the dialog (laughed out loud several times), the fight scenes, and the imagery.  However, the author needs to use commas appropriately.  Many phrases run together, and this requires frequent rereading and takes away from immersion in the story.  Sometimes there was way too much geopolitical/historical information causing the plot to bog down and the reader to fall asleep (sorry!).  Better editing and trimming would keep the tension and keep the reader engaged.  The story is worth additional refining, and the characters are worth the effort!",4,1

She becomes Grayson's new best friend and has a good time with him while she has to balance a new job.I loved the romantic part of the movie that deals with the budding relationship between her and the ""Harvard Hottie"" and the scene where they play tennis together. The two of them have a great chemistry and it is nice to see how their relationship grows through the film.Scarlett Johansson does an excellent job acting in this movie and I am a fan of her movies (I remember watching 'If Lucy Fell' when she was a lot younger).

IF you can still find it, their follow-up album King of the Dead, with Toccata in dminor, Finger of Scorn, King of the Dead, Atom Smasher, Black Machine, Cirith Ungol, and Master of the Pit is a great compliment to the other CD and the two will make quite a compilation of all their early great stuff.",5,1

To sum it up the CD has no life and is boring and true let down. Their first CD only sold as much as it did because of the MTB3 show exposure and not on its content and their vocal ability. (Buy Day 26's CD instead if you want to hear what a hot CD sounds like.)",1,0

8547422,Not Your Everyday Little Red Fairytale,I really couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy of Little Red by Trista Jaszczak.  So worth the wait.  One the title being Little Red which was my CB handle hence the name of my blog Little Red's Book Reviews and two I always liked the story of Little Red Riding Hood.  Well lets just say this is FAR FROM the childhood classic.  Trista gives it a whole new twist.  I really enjoyed the story and really love how she took this classic and turned it in to an adult &#34;fairytale&#34; if you will.  It's funny reading about Little Red  being on a motorcycle and not skipping through the forest to Grandmother's house.  Trista you did a great job with this story.  This was a page turner.

Unicasting is one to one, and broadcasting is one to all, so many services and platforms may not be used to its utmost efficiency.

4240836,Great book,"This book could not possibly be more objective or well-researched. A triumph.By the way - regarding the review by ""Rafael K"" - even if sputtering his way through a fit of sanctimonious indignation over the U.N. being called out, it seems only proper that a reviewer might wipe down his monitor and calm himself so as to write intelligibly. What in the world does this mean: ""The book does meet neither minimal journalistic standards nor reporting ethics""? We are to trust the opinion of the person who wrote that sentence?

Sure there are a lot of great musicians in the band, but without any framework for the improvisation it just ends up sounding like chaos. The players themselves, quoted in the liner notes, express reservations, saying that they had no idea what to play when Miles walked off the stage. It was a short-lived band and all but the leader moved on to more structured forms of music. Obviously others hear something here that I don't, but it just gave me a headache trying to listen to it.",1,0

I had to  check the copyright date on this book to see what happened to Ms. Miller,  who is usually a favorite of mine.  Copyright was 1985 so I am happy to  report that she has definitely improved from 15 years ago. But, the  experience taught me not to buy &quot;everything&quot; by an author......  The bad news is the book is just plain awful.......the good news is Ms.  Miller writes very well these days.......love scenes are tasteful and  balanced with the story and her stories are strong.

Once there his family skillfully manipulates him into marrying beautiful, educated, spinster Leila.  Neel is under the belief that he can get a quickie divorce in the United States and continue his relationship with blonde, American,Caroline.  I thought this book was highly realistic with how Neel was leading on both Caroline as well as Leila, making decisions simply by refusing to make a decision.  I especially thought the author did a good job of showcasing Neel's inner conflict between the customs of India with his newfound beliefs in the United States.  Leila's thoughts at being caught in a trap of a false marriage was also well-done.  I look forward to more by this author.",4,1
4303309,This is a great tool.,The idea of this book is not to give an in depth study but to give the reader and student a summary of each book.

(almost 60 pages itself)This is, quite simply, one of the best Bibles you could ever get your hands on.As the subtitle suggests, it covers far more than just money issues.

2900286,Excellent prequel,"With excellent jokes and storytelling, plus subtle and not-so-subtle visual humor, this is an excellent read. Though not vital knowledge for anyone reading the online strip, I've started to notice a few references to the back story creeping into the current dialog.There is one drawback to this novel, and Mr. Burlew even mentions it in the preface. Sometimes the story gets pretty dark. And I'm not talking about gallows humor dark but actual depressing dark. These guys turn evil for a reason, and it's not that much fun to discover why. Xykon, that lovably two-dimensional parody of evil, takes on depths of depravity that turn him into someone you truly hate.",5,1

440717,Flat Formula,"No doubt, the ingredients of a great thriller exist in Day of Reckoning.  The villains are evil, the locations are exotic and the heroes are gallant.  Unfortunately, all of these assets are thin and flat.  The villains are dunces, unable to appreciate or even emotionally react to threats and disasters.  The heroes are cool, almost  bored.  While revenge for a brutal murder is at stake, no real danger threaten them.  It's a sleepwalk to the final page.Please understand, I am a big Higgins fan that found the Dillon/Blake partnership to be entertaining in The President's Daughter and The Whitehouse Connection.

A book that  takes on such familiar themes as  the selfish gene theory, but cooperation,  competition, and gossip is fine, but this book goes into economics,  politics (conservative and liberal) , human history, the actions of  presidents... and does it very, very, well.  This is truly an incredible  book.  Along with Jared Diamond's &quot;The Third Chimpanzee&quot;, and  Richard Dawkins &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, this belongs on EVERYONE'S  shelf.

1263809,Unsurpassed,"I read this book when it was first published, and I've re-read it frequently over the years. I still marvel at Rice's writing talent, her sublime skill at creating characters that you can see so vividly from the page.  It takes considerable talent to provide the detail that she does and still excel at moving a story at such a brisk pace. Interview remains one of my favorite modern novels and my favorite novel about vampires. Yes, it surpasses Bram Stoker's Dracula and Stephenie Meyer's Twilight, both which I liked very much.This is a novel that just absorbs you, separates you from real space and real time and inserts you as a witness of an enthralling story.  Every time I read it, I still mourn Armand and hope things are resolved differently.The movie, by comparison, was simply atrocious. I can't believe that anyone who read this book could envision Tom Cruise as Lestat and Brad Pitt as Louis.

Also included are guilty pleasures like the Wang Chung cut,  Stray Cats' &quot;Rock This Town&quot;, and Culture Club's &quot;Karma  Chameleon&quot;.

3939535,Surprised me!,"I didn't know what to expect from this book, since I didn't read the series that came before it. I was sort of expecting yet another predicable storyline, lots of typos, the usual stuff you get from self-published authors. Surprise, surprise, it got my interest from the start and kept it. The writing style was edgy without being obnoxious and yes, the plot revolves around drug use and other bad choices, but it's handled in a realistic way. Michelle Mankin also seems to know the ins and outs of touring because that aspect was covered in a realistic way, too. And typos? If there were any, they were too minor to remember.My only complaint is the constant back-and-forth movement of the plot using flashbacks, but it wasn't enough to detract from my rating. This is still a solid book with characters I cared about even though they were far from perfect human beings. Good job and I am looking forward to the next one in this series.",5,1

You may have already guessed that I loved Jim to bits and now I am dying to get my hands on the rest of this series to read about Joy&#8217;s adventures.In summation, this is an excellent sample of the author&#8217;s work that left me wanting to try more!Find On Shadowed Wings on Goodreads",5,1
4344557,Madame President,"After reading &#34;Guilt by Association&#34; I knew I had to read this one.  I'd read a smidgen of the book and it grabbed me from page one.  I ordered the kindle edition on Saturday April 19th and finished in Sunday April 20th.  The book was one, at least for me, that I couldn't put down.  The use of flashbacks tucked in the plot gave me the background of Madame President's life prior to becoming POTUS.  Her handling of some unsavory political 'colleagues' was one I could back.  I'm not telling too much of the plot.  If you want to know more you're going to have to buy this book and READ it for yourself.",5,1

2042696,Better then Smoke Thief.,"I have to admit, this story held me captive because I loved the personality of Zane. So tough, yet so compassionate toward Lia, trying so hard not to love her, even though it shown through everytime her glanced at her.I liked Lia a lot too, she was a much stronger character then Rue was in the first book.I still didnt appreciate the detailed sex scenes, just like in the first book, but in this book they werent quite as bad and drawn out. I prefer to use my own imagination when it comes to love, I dont need it spelled out for me.There was some real good exciting parts in this book, very well written, so now Im excited to read the next in line ""Queen of Dragons"".",4,1

With that said, if you are a record collector that has come across countless Verve albums in the bins, and have been curious about the other artists out there, this is a perfect way to begin.  The prime guilty pleasure here is bossa nova, with shades of jazz thrown in, and while you may not have heard of any of the artists covered here, many of them have not been heard since their original releases 30+ years ago.  Excellent, hunt down the vinyl version as I did.",5,1

My home no longer has dead spots.  I am only using two units to cover a 4,400 sq. ft. 2 story home.  One at the Uverse modem, one upstairs about 40 feet away.  They look like one network and I can move around through the home and get great reception everywhere.What a great product!

7303729,"Muffled Audio, Uncomfortable to Wear","These on-ear headphones are adjustable, sliding along metal wire.  The fit is only fair, with the front of the headphones pulling slightly away from the ears.  They cannot really be adjusted to correct for that flaw.  The headphones are not very comfortable; the fit creates a couple of pressure points on the outer ear.  My daughter, who has started using these headphones with her portable DVD player and Kindle Fire, has not complained about the fit so far.  The attractive white and red color scheme is appealing to her.Construction appears shoddy.  The cord and plug are already pulling apart after little use.Most importantly, sound is not that great.  As opposed to some high quality headphones that are heavy on the bass, these just have an overly muffled quality.Overall, I would not recommend these headphones, but they work ok as inexpensive headphones for a child.",2,0

I think it will benefit the younger set because they will learn and develop important skills in order to move through the game.  And I think the game is enticing enough that they will want to &#34;keep at it&#34;.  I downloaded it because it sounded interesting but predominately because it was the FAOTD!

I was vaguely aware of transportation of orphans but certainly not aware it went on for years.  I think the practice was started with the best intentions.  Who knows what would have become of all these children?  That being said I was appalled at the lack of checking out ""adoptive"" parents ,record keeping,  and follow up.  To have left a child with those people when it was obvious they could not take care of their own children was criminal.  I greatly admire the real children that did survive and prospered.",4,1

Some of the topics are a bit in depth for the beginner and sometimes are a bit complex to understand.

Just make sure that you realize it is not for texas hold'em specifically but for general concepts of all poker and many examples will be from other types of poker games (7-stud, omaha, hi-lo games, etc...).

8627502,A historical curio,"This is an interesting piece of 30's pop art, but that's about all. It has nothing to do with the play or with its spirit, or with making its corresponding image in a new medium. It's a star vehicle for the &quot;names&quot; in the cast, some of whom get by with some dignity, others of whom - Mickey Rooney in particular - are just embarrassing. It does have some fairly spectacular imagery for the time and technology - fun to watch, on a certain level, but only as a quaint cinema knick-knack of its day. I really can't imagine presenting this hopelessly dated piece of fluff to secondary school students (as one reviewer claims to do), and trying to trick them into believing that this is the Bard as we know and love him as educated grownups.",2,0

2716204,What freedom means,"The Giver won a myriad of awards and deserved every one. My criteria for awarding my 5 stars is, ""Will I remember this story next week and does it leave me pondering the book's ending?"" The Giver makes us think about freedom at the most basic level. We must also ponder which is more important, freedom or safety, having needs immediately satisfied through keeping people ignorant or allowing people to make their own decisions though they won't have the cushion of large numbers of people to accomplish goals. Can people live with harsh punishments for breaking miniscule rules? The Giver asks us to ponder many such questions and to contemplate how the story may relate to our own government and how our liberty and freedoms have been and continue to be diluted and even stolen by socialistic leaders.",5,1
4492640,It works,"Good philosophy.  Although I didn't particularly like the way they refer to children as if they are animals.  It read like a dog training book.  There are some good take aways, but I don't follow this to the letter.  I still count and follow through and do time out.  It works, yes.  But try to use a little more compassion than this book recommends.  This book insists you be an emotionless robot.

3694752,The Memory Child,The Memory Child by Steena Holmes is a solid 5 star rating. Once I started reading I didn't want to put it down until I was finished. Ms. Holmes has written a very powerful book! She addresses the issue of postpartum depression within a love story. Brian and Diane are a couple deeply in love. When Brian learns that Diane is expecting he has to convince her that what happened to mother will not happen to her. He is a source of strength to Diane. Suddenly tragedy strikes.

We are a book club of two and often read mountaineering books together. I selected this in that vein. I enjoyed it very much on  personal level. My husband's first reaction was &#34;who is this guy, never heard of him&#34;. I think the reason is that Reynolds is a hiker/tramper and not an ice climbing, technical mountaineer/rock climber. In the European vein of trail hiking the mountains, this book is a completely different animal than accounts of Denali, Annapurna or K2.As a memoir it is a nice read; as long as you understand what Mr. Reynolds' experience is, you might enjoy this slim book as well.",4,1
4559087,Creative and thought-provoking,"Metagame is a page-turning adventure book which also poses some philosophical questions about our current trend toward entertainment technology.

Yet, he finds himself carrying too strong of emotional responses to the routines and procedures within the world he lives. He is offered an opportunity to play with the 'nobles' of society and finds there is more to the game world than he knew.The occasional error was not enough to pull me from the book, and I very much appreciated the fact the author did not spoon feed, allowing for someone intelligent to build the world in their minds instead of relying upon the narrative to do so. I was immersed right from the start, and had a hard time putting the book down to get stuff done. Excellent debut novel.",5,1

I think Amy Allen wrote this more for the woman hiker set as well as for those that approach the journey as a means to a life transformational event.  She writes very well, the storey ties together, is informative for those thinking about hiking the AT and, ultimately was entertaining.  It took a while in the early stages of the book to get beyond all the &#34;New Age&#34; babble (I mean a shaman induced protective bubble for our author as she hikes.....well, it takes all kinds) in order to get to what is really a good, heart felt narrative.

Seeking out the fantasies of the lives of those historical figures I have loved and admired would have, at the time, been a welcome respite.  I cannot relate the doorways, stones and tiled floors I have touched throughout my life trying to conjure a sense of those who walked them before me.I found the The Hands of Time a bit of an escapist read, but not a seriously historical one.  It was for me more of a historical romance set within a time travel theme.  However, I enjoyed the escape and was thrilled that Valerie found in 1605 what she lacked in her modern life.  I also enjoyed Shapiro&#8217;s interjection of clues left by Valerie for the family she left behind, especially those to her sister.I enjoyed this novel not because it was one that stirred the Historian in me to research and debate, but more because it soothed the soul or at least this one.",4,1

699778,"Great book, off the mark!","In this book Ray Bradbury, one of my favorite authors, did not become Nostradamus. His story did not account for the internet. Therefore, many of the political ideas simply won't appeal to the internet generation, where information is only a fingertip away.On the other hand there are valid points regarding the ""opiates"" of life. Unfortunately, when you are young you look at it and say ""look at what they are doing to us"", which is what our protagonist does. As you become wiser you begin to see that the statement is really ""look at what we have done to ourselves"", which is what he finally discovers when he joins the band of scholars.This is an all time classic, but the reverse is happening in our society. There is too much information and no filters/censorship. So we need to be more alert for misinformation and propaganda, than we have ever needed to before.Own the book.",5,1

Him and Pauly in the meat factory was a great scene, really gripping. The only iffy part with me was the fight, how it was filmed, it got a little boring and I'm not sure I liked the way it was set up to make it look like a real fight on HBO, it just didn't sit right with me or something.

She and Terrence Howard whom I also love give riveting performances in Winnie. When they put Winnie in jail for over 400 days in solitary confinement I felt like my heart would burst with sympathy for her, her children and Mandela who was also in prison. The movie makes us aware that Winnie made mistakes but considering the great pressures thrust upon her shoulders I think anyone viewing the movie would have at least a little understanding of what occurred and wish Winnie well.  I wish that Mandela had fought for Winnie upon his release from jail, I wish Winnie had never been involved with mayhem, I wish her life had been completely exemplary but I love what Jennifer Hudson did with the role",5,1
4569267,Cant put it down,"Another addictive read by the great Alice Clayton. Very humourous, alot of (super hot) sex, a super sweet but very masculine hero, a relationship that defies the odds, a sometimes frustrating heroine with her neurotic female brain. Worth the time to read it, which is no time at all as once you start you cant stop.",5,1

You will not be able to match it to anything of quality.It also came scratched up and poorly packaged.When I contacted the seller to retun the item, they would not pay for the shipping back, even though item was not as advertized.Shipping this heavy, large item will cost me close to what I paid for this crap, so why would I bother returning it?It's sitting in my basement still in the torn up box. I have a claim going on with amazon about this seller and item, we will see how it goes. It's been months of no resolution and rude customer service from the seller. If I end up keeping this purple monster, I guess I'll use it in the basement where it's dark and no one can see it.",1,0

I'll be deleting this from my Kindle! :(",1,0
496545,Love this series...,"...of Wallflower novels.  My favorite of the series is Secrets of a Summer Night; I don't think any of the others quite measures up to it, but they're all extremely enjoyable in their own ways.  I am sorry to see this series end.  Kleypas is probably my favorite romance author at this point; I always look forward to a new book from her.  Hey, are any of you other fans thinking what I've been thinking...how about a book about the Gypsy Cam Rohan, who was enticingly introduced in Devil in Winter and never heard from again??  I thought he was a lot more interesting than the hero of this new book, and I was kind of hoping Kleypas would find a way to bring him and Daisy together.  One can only hope....but back to the subject at hand; this is a book that is well worth your while, and I hope those who have not yet read Kleypas' wonderful books will check out the whole series.",4,1
7905719,Great little microwave!,"This little beauty does every thing I need. Like other reviewers I don't try to cook a 5 course dinner in it. I'm happy to have it thaw, reheat, warm up, and brew. Baked spuds come out great in same time a big oven would take. It's really cute and takes up very little space. Put index finger against  front and thumb under door handle and door opens easily without dragging it across cabinet. I like that it's light weight. I can move it and clean under it without waiting until I have help to do it. Can't say about durability as I haven't had for long but so far so good.",5,1

6049490,Curdled Cream...what's the point of this?,"This comes across as a MONEY thing...a big stinky business deal. No NEW album, just play the old tunes for the ""old"" fans. Yuck! Some of the songs are of course classic, but the performances sound a little tired at times. The sound quality is solid but too clinical sounding for its own good. Like an earlier reviewer wrote: Pick up the early live albums, volume 1 and 2 instead. Now maybe I would have felt different if this was to promote a NEW studio album, but it's all just, nostalgia.My other favorite ""classic rock"" band Deep Purple, do have a NEW album, ""Rapture of the Deep"" and it truly kicks arse! New material selling close to a million copies already, ""Rapture of the Deep"" is one of the finest albums of '05. Bravo DP!What will sadden me is that the media will promote this recycled rubbish from Cream, but completely ignore the innovative and NEW Deep Purple album. Go figure. Talk about the state of the ""ART!""",2,0
4796730,A blockbuster book,This book is a good book  about slavery and its horror. I think that this should be on the list for must-read to let everyone know of the horror of slavery then and all horror of prejudices now.  It is a shame that very little has changed.

As far as baseball movies go, the on the field action was pretty good and getting to see Kelly Preston on screen isn't bad either. At times it starts to lean a bit to far in the &#34;chick flick&#34; category, but that aside I will enjoy having it in my DVD collection.",4,1

I bought it because I saw lots of positive reviews and it seemed to be one of the best in this category. And sure enough, it didn't disappoint me at all. The content is top-notch. It's clear and concise and backed by research and studies. Reading this book is like having a good friend sharing knowledge and giving you genuine advice about the subject.The author is authentic. When it comes to bodybuilding there's a lot of theories that can't be concluded to be right or wrong, but you won't see him making a claim that he knows the right answer. He just gives you practical advice about it.If you're into bodybuilding (and have a tendency to believe everything that the media and the bodybuilding mags are regurgitating), I highly recommend this book.",5,1

2425230,A fun book to share!,Beach Day is a story of a little child's trip to the beach. It is approx. 5 1/4 by 5 3/4 in size with eleven pages. This size can easily be held by a child. The illustrations are colorful and can hold a pre-reader's attention. The pages are sturdy and could easily handle a trip to the beach. There is really not a story but instead describes the child greeting many of the sights one might find at the beach.,4,1

3816111,Great story,"Pay no attention to the cover. I don't think the artist read the book because Montana probably doesn't look like the English countryside.

You won't regret reading this book.",5,1
6892296,Really Disappointed wiht Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZR3,"Bought the camera in July, just before our vacation abroad. Attributed lousy photos so far to getting used to the camera. But honestly, I am getting much better results with my ancient Canon than with this new one. About 80%-90% of photos are out of focus. It takes ages to photo - way too long between the time you click the shutter button and when the photo is actually taken. When taking pictures of children - or like taking pictures in a restaurant's kitchen like I did today - the mili-second is of importance. This camera isn't smart enough to adjust to different lighting conditions. To cut a long story short - hugely disappointing.I should start looking for the next one right away.By the way, I bought it because of its small size and weight and was impressed with most reviews I read and technical data. Don't be fooled: it's really small and can fit into a flexible pocket, but I am sure there are better cameras than this one.",2,0

2598662,an excellent YA novel,"Reading a Young Adult novel is rather outside of my comfort zone, but this one is such a fantastic one, I did not find it too be difficult. It is written in The first person deep point of view, which means the whole book is written completely from Shannon's perspective. This was cool, because I was not at all distracted by the other characters agenda, thoughts or actions. Melody gives us a fresh look at the Amish which in this time where a lot of attention is being given to this lifestyle and their religious beliefs, seems like a difficult job.Many aspects are brought to life, from their dress, work ethics and ordnance. Although we read a lot of books where the Amish way of life is romanticized as Shannon looks in from the outside, she sees the other side as well.I received this book free from Fred at The Book Club Network and Revell books in exchange for an honest review. A positive critique was not required. The opinions are my own.",5,1

I absolutely LOVED the story, adore Kyle, Stephen and Ben and to be honest did not miss Sam or the Marrock one bit. This time we also read a bit from Adam's perspective, which was enlightening.

The sex scenes between them is off the charts and it makes you want to jump through the pages. Dom, Keisha, Marcus, and Aleesha are back as well and you can't get no better then to have friends who have your back and who is like family.

Some perverted sexual content (not shown) about a situation portrayed while trying to solve the murder case.  So caution to parents.  I would not let my children under the age of 15 or 16 watch this movie.  But this was not a gory detective movie, like most movies on the market today.  All blood and guts!

5271141,Nice Book,"These readings are really a portal to the next world.  McGinnis gets very detailed answers to his questions about what heaven is like, what God is like, and what the human soul is like.  The news is good all around.  It turns out that God is not punitive, but rather an all-forgiving and all-loving figure.  No soul is banished from heaven.  I think this book is a good antidote to fear of death and mourning for lost friends and loved ones.  People report unanimously that heaven is all love and fulfillment, not sitting on clouds with harps.  Souls in heaven are busy.",5,1

This fan is compact enough that it sits on my desk and doesn't get in the way of any of the other things I have laying around. It has a nice black finish and it is made of metal so it has some decent weight to it. This simply means that if you knock it accidentally with something, it won't topple over behind the desk and be lost forever.There is only two settings. On and Off. I don't mind because I just turn it on when I arrive and turn it off when I leave.It makes some noise but it is mostly white noise which doesn't bother me during phone calls or meetings. If I'm listening to something quiet on the computer, I will sometimes turn it off to hear better but I generally don't even notice it anymore.",5,1

2301241,"""You're talking to the man who put on a golf tournament in North Korea with O.J. Simpson""","""You're talking to the man who put on a golf tournament in North Korea with O.J. Simpson.""With his latest offering full of such zinger comments, Christopher Buckley, son of famed Conservative author William F. Buckley, takes on Islam in this one. It is not hard to figure out who is supposed to be whom in this one and the topic women's rights in Arabia is certainly a topical and fertile ground.A little too long for my tastes (just a couple of twists and turns too many), it was, nonetheless, an enjoyable listen. The reader, Carrington MacDuffie does a good, but not great job. She has trouble with all of the accents (sometimes her French and Arabic accents get muddled together), but she does a good job as the voice of ""Florence"".I give this one a grade of B+. Recommended, especially if you have an interest in Middle East politics.",4,1
1180779,Funny read,"I love Tina Fey's unique sense of humor and have been a big fan of her on both SNL and 30 Rock. This book is funny, but be aware that it is an autobiography. Ms. Fey bares her soul, and that includes significant self esteem issues. You expect that from a comedian (""crying on the inside"") but after awhile it was sort of depressing. Still, there are lots of laughs and I would recommend it as long as you're a fan of autobiographies.",4,1

The almond was so easy to set up and solved the problem...now I have a very strong wi-fi signal....I am so happy that I found the almond--a true solution!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED AS AN EXTENDER!Update August 7, 2013:  I bought aRoku 3 Streaming Playerand it worked great on the signal from the Almond.  When I hooked it up to the regular wireless in the house (I have aMedialink - Wireless N Broadband Router - 300 Mbps - 2.4GHz - 802.11n w/ Internal Antennathat I am very happy with), the Roku had trouble getting a signal.  Both are equidistant from where I placed the Roku....so I know that the Almond is really, really great!  Can't wait to buy their updated version when it comes out next year.",5,1
6156866,Interesting collaboration,"This is charming and melodic collaboration between a cellist and an African koro player. The title is accurate, in that it is chamber music or music played in a small room. It is not &#34;classical&#34; whatever that means, but these two guys listen to each other and improvise. It is contemplative and joyous, highly original and defies classification. It reminds me of a Ryan Cooder duet with an Indian musician, A Meeting By the River. Highly recommended.",5,1

I looked forward, with anticipation, each week that it was on. Come on, bring this to disc already! Update: I was able to find this online to watch hee hee. I'm sure Gary Cole doesn't care that it's online for people to watch - only certain big wig types. Happy watching :)",5,1

3293690,A very interesting study in the dirty details of politics,"This is a book that all lawmakers and politicians should read every few years (not that they would though). I really enjoyed the cause and effects of the actions of lawmakers and I thought the author did a good job of laying out the framework of what makes a good law and what the issues are with most laws. He goes through many traps that the lawmakers find themselves might and might not find themselves and I thought those were well structured. In today's highly partisan political environment it would be refreshing if the members of Congress were to understand these ""traps"" and I do have faith that someday they will. In summary, this is quite an unusual book and that it why I would recommend it to anyone interested in politics.",4,1
4083909,Thoroughly enjoyable,"Part history of a disappearing culture, part family biography, part confessional catharsis, this book traces the lives of five generations of the author's family, and their journey from Kurdistan to Israel and the US. As someone interested in family geneology, this book provides a fascinating glimpse into the lives of a family from a very different part of the world, and their immigration experiences. As someone interested in history, this book covers a world of which I had no knowledge. As someone who likes to read, this book approached the subject with a tenderness and emotional honesty and introsprection that was rewarding, and made the book much more personal than simply family history -- it is both about family and the complex emotional bonds and upheavals as it is about family history, and the threads weaving through the past. It is about assimilation, discovery and survival.Altogether, it was thought provoking and immersive.",5,1

Marlix has his hands full from the moment he steals her away from the bazaar. Lots of sex and a few hot spankings make this a must read for all of Cara's fan. A few little tidbits dropped near the end of the book sets the stage for the third book. Can't wait to read it.,5,1
5726517,Some strong points,"I purchased this CD mainly for the theme song to the television show.  It appears twice on the CD, once as it's original version as once on how it appears on TV.  It is a good song, but &quot;I Go Blind&quot; is by far the  best song.  &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot; is catchy.  But so is  &quot;Sexuality&quot;, which, though has a great tune, has really  cheesey(that's right, I said the word cheesey) lyrics.  &quot;You'll Know  You Were Loved&quot; is just the opposite-great lyrics but I don't think  Lou Reed has a very good voice.  &quot;Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Shoe  Box&quot; are also good.  &quot;Good Intentions&quot; is kind of boring.  I  really liked the little tansitions between songs that had little bits of  the TV show in it.  They really give a taste of what the show is like.",4,1
1280809,This really goes on for WAY too long,"I found myself finishing this one not because I wanted to see how it ended, but rather after 500 pages I felt like ""...I've already gone this far.""Bit of background...I've read all of the Belgarion and Sparhawk novels, as well as The Losers, Belgarath, and Polgara so I know the style. Amusing but sometimes repetitive narration centered around lovable and interesting characters. I was very pleased to meet some new players, and I admire that they wanted to keep it to one novel this time, but concepts are not explored and characters are not developed enough in what could have been at least a trilogy. Instead of wanting more, I was left wanting the novel to just get on with it. This may have been solved with smaller doses (or episodes), because although I enjoyed it, it was simply played out after the first 600+ pages.",2,0

1842535,Light And Fluffy,"Never saw the movie, so I can't comment on comparisons. The author intro to the novel about her experience of adapting this book to the movie and her experiences on the set were embarrassing. She gushes on and on about being with popular actors, I felt embarrassed for, quite sad really. Obviously the biggest, most important highlight in her life. I get the feeling that if you knew her, she would be constantly bringing it up and name dropping.By now the book is a little dated but not bad. I loved all the family dynamics. A few people in the book are quite trashy. The ending fell quite flat, not much closure.",4,1
5743188,I Can't Decide Between 3 Or 4 Stars!,"Maybe 3.5 stars because the good is fantastic, but some of the rest is anything but fantastic.The title track is a true John Lennon classic which will stand the test of time for as long as music is played.Crippled Inside is sung in a knockabout style, rather similar to The Band, but don't be fooled, there's a serious message underlying the cheerfully laidback presentation.With Jealous Guy, well, I say forget about the Roxy Music version, this is the original and best by a mile.Give Me Some Truth has excellent lyrics, but the guitars distort, making it harder to follow John's protest.How Do You Sleep, a non veiled rage against Paul McCartney, also includes what I hear as untuneful sounds. However there's no doubting the message of vemon, it beats Bob Dylan's Positively Fourth Street for bad mouthing you're ex friends.Oh My Love and Oh Yoko are love songs, so you can see this is an album of considerable contrasts.I suggest you hear it and decide for yourself.",4,1

5840497,Not the typical Emo album,"wow! This album is truly something! This is not the typical emo album, crying about their girl troubles. Most emo albums you listen to, the singer has broken his heart and wants sympathy.

Or his ""postcards on the floor, but his pen can't write lonliness no more"" (-- The Ataris ""Road signs and Rock stars""). This album takes the rather opposite approach. Chris Conley (Lead singer/song writer/guitarist) writes about getting back at the girl who has broken his heart. Chopping off her legs, splashing lemonade in her face, shoving mud down her throat, etc. If you have ever been dumped by a girl and instead of feeling bad, you want to take some action. this album is for you!",4,1

As he does this, he shows us a completely  different being, in attitude at least, than the smug, self-assured Q we are  used to seeing on the TV series. We also see that Q was at least indirectly  behind several of the adventures of Kirk and his Enterprise.",5,1

1433935,A great mixture of philosophy and biography,"After reading Bryan Magee's The Story of Philosophy I got the itch to read some of his other books. This is the first one I picked up. It is a great read. It tells the story of his own journey through philosophy, how he  became interested in philosophy and the intellectual journey he took to get  from his childhood curiosity about philosophy to the point he is at today.  As one digests each chapter one gets exposed to many of the philosophers  who have shaped the content and direction of philosophy over the centuries.  Magee not only summarizes the main ideas of the philosophers who have  influenced him but also gives his opinion as to where they were right,  where they were wrong and how they fit into the total picture. His  explanation of how we can still learn from a philosopher even when he is  wrong is especially good. I recommend the book highly for anyone who has  some background in philosophy.",5,1
6094204,"Nice Trip Back To ""Real Performers""","I grew up listening to Elvis Presley's music. Both my parents played the records and I remember his concert in our city. The CD features GREAT LIVE performances by the King himself in Vegas. My only complaint was the inclusion of the title song which isn't LIVE. It is not enough of a distraction however to impact what I think is aNICE collection. The song selection includes American Trilogy which is an Elvis trademark, and my favorite ""CC Rider"". There are also amazing covers of Bridge OverTroubled Waters, and Can't Help Falling In Love. Listening to this CD takes me back to my youth.

I have read hundreds of books and even though I have not found one that really has the answers this one will definitely help someone sometime.  Well written and useful.  For those that truly suffer you probably need two or three books just to get all the info you may need.  Mastery of your Anxiety and Panic would go good with this book.  Basically, a good book but not the answer.  Unfortunately, I dont know if a book will ever be the answer to everyones panic attacks. But for some it may be worth a try.",4,1
5373662,Miss George's Second Chance,"It&#8217;s a short book, just around 100 pages, but Boyd manages to nicely create a tender love story about two people whose feelings for each other go deeper than they let on. And by hiding, they manage to make the other believe that they don&#8217;t care. So when Imogen makes her sacrifice by giving Peter his freedom to go find someone he can love, neither let on to how much they actually want to be together and just continue to hide those feelings from others.As misunderstandings in romances go, this one is a classic and I think it is handled very well. Once the two are back in the same sphere it, with a little help from their friends, they quickly figure things out and the path to their Happy Ever After is heartfelt and sweet. Peter proves himself to be one of the best heroes a heroine could ever ask for.Full review available at Romantic Reads and Such on wordpress.",4,1

It has excellent pacing, a comic feel though it isn't strictly comedy, and the lead character does an excellent job of &#34;humanizing&#34; a completely alien cosmos.The author's creativity is evident on every page, and it makes the storyline entertaining.  Hank is the opposite of a traditional space hero, yet he feels more plausible than most.  It was very easy to suspend disbelief and flow along the plot.I look forward to the rest.",4,1

8651351,American Zatoichi,"For those who don't know, that is a blind swordfighter.  Yeah, I know, it sounds either really cool, or really stupid.  But it is a pretty entertaining film.The fights are quick and creative, and Hauer is convincing enough as a blind man.  It's a nice change to see him play an entirely sympathetic character, given the bad guy roles he is known for playing.This is also one of those films that features an excellent child actor that I have not seen in a long time.  His name is Brandon Call and I remember seeing him in several films of the time, but unfortunately he did not make the crossover to adult star.  One hopes that this was a choice.For whichever reason, it was a loss, because he gives a full-blown (without being over-the-top) performance as the boy who gets attached to Nick in the search for his father.I don't mention the plot in detail, because there isn't much.  It's really just a buddy road picture showcase for the fight scenes.  But the performances raise it above the average.Try it out.",4,1

7099120,Works with Macs,"Although most Apple machines come with wecams, users of the Mac Mini or Mac Pro are out of luck. It's difficult to find Mac compatible webcams: a lot of consumer cams work, but usually there's no mention of it on the packaging. Well, these work fine. You don't even need drivers.There's no software in the box for the Mac, but since the software is the same for all cams in this series, just use the software from another model.The downside is the lack of controls for adjusting the picture. Apple's built-in cams do a good job of optimising the image, so hey didn't write any software, and the Logitech software for OS X doesn't do anything either. I used the cam in a Windows PC and here were extensive controls available.Picture quality is good, and way better than the average built-in camera on a sub $1000 laptop. Video is pretty good but lacks enough controls to be useful for more than Skype. The detail levels are  high enough the average Skype connection can't keep up.A worthy cam for those who need one.",4,1

I love inside the covers, the way she tells a story about her family and about why she sees beauty in some of the most beastly things.

1752510,This is my kind of science fiction book.,"Apart from the Star Wars novels, I'm not much of a science fiction reader.  Over the years, I've waded through a few volumes by various authors but never found anything that truly captivated me.  ""The Clone Republic"" however had me hooked from the first page.  I finished it in three days--which is quite a feat for a slow reader like me.This book avoids all of the things I have disliked in other sci-fi works.  There are no invading bug-eyed aliens.  There are no mutant/advanced humans with strange powers.  There is no babbling on about theoretical science and advanced technology.  And there is no plodding plot.Instead, the author gives us likable characters and a storyline that starts strong and keeps building to a climax that is satisfying yet also leaves one wanting more.I look forward to getting the next book in the series.

574554,Chef Boyardee Italian,"I read The Shoemaker's Wife because someone in my book club suggested it.  The novel was cheesy and so chocked full of Italian immigrant stereotypes that I didn't really feel the characters were real. They were Chef Boyardee Italians, mythical figures created to appeal to an American audience.  (Not that there wasn't a real Chef Boyardee, but he's been Americanized to sell canned pasta.) Enza, the pious, long-suffering immigrant woman who crosses the ocean to create a better life for herself and her family back home in Italy.  Ciro, the immigrant shoemaker who pulls himself up by his bootstraps by, lo and behold, making actual boots (and shoes).  The two hard-working Italians build a life together through blood, sweat, and tears.  Blah, blah, blah.  I was actually more interested in Ciro's rocky relationship with the Catholic Church and his bond with his brother who became a priest than I was with his long, drawn-out courtship with Enza.",2,0

At first I wasn't sure if I liked him or not, but as the pages flew by I couldn't help but smile at the eccentricities of Detective Lawless. This book is a great mix of horror, dark humor and some Sci-Fi thrown in just to make it interesting. I have to admit there were a couple chapters that for me, were a bit long and probably should have been shortened to move the story along a little faster, but that's just my opinion, and overall I really enjoyed this book. This story is definitely worth your time.

I know that every time I see someone bring up women's issues, the eyes start to roll, but believe me, if it was your mother or sister, aunt or daughter being victimized right now, your eyes would not be rolling.Once I started this, I couldn't stop-- its a good message and a good read.  It was very emotional for me though, because I was attacked several years ago and those fears and emotions never go away-- and just reading this brought all those feelings back for me.This is definitely a good read, and I honestly think folks need to pick up more stuff like this.

9246717,A romantic escape,"For those of you who love the romantic and proper days of the Victorian era, this series is for you! These are the days when men courted women, and women dreamed of marrying, raising children and running a household. Men were chivalrous and proper and women were classy with impecible manners. It's a shame, sometimes, that progress happens, because these are times when innocence and virtue were not bad things. Just the tiny events that happen in Cranford were made much bigger by reactions, overreactions, gossip and horrible misunderstandings. Not to mention, the very saddest times were overcome by family support, deep and lasting friendships, and a deep faith in God and, well, kindness to one's fellow man. Judi Dench is wonderful, as are most of the lesser-known cast members (although there are several well-known actors who are superb - Imelda Staunton being one). Wonderful on a cold Saturday or Sunday night when nothing is on cable.",5,1

He wants the girl, he doesn't want the girl, he disappears until HE is ready to commit. Sorry fella, I would have been gone a long time ago.This story was interesting in some places, the danger, the electricity between the two. However, what they had was not love, it was lust and if the &#34;love scenes&#34; didn't get in the way, it could have been a good read",2,0

The author, Tan Twan Eng is able to make use of Malayanhistory to create the twists and turns of plot, while making us enjoy each and every character as well.",5,1

2248431,Typical Sarah,"I love this woman! She cannot be any better of a writer, she keeps her stories short and clever telling nothing but the truth! This is yet another book that I never wanted to put down because it was just that great!I did read this a long time ago, her most recent book left a bad taste in my mouth, but I'll just have to go back and read this again just so I can put good thoughts about her back in my mind! :)",5,1

8047474,What,"I'm kind of wondering what happened with Selange.**spoiler**Exactly how did these two fall in love and can't stop thinking about each other?  I don't see how it lead up to this point with the two?  From father/uncle figure to lover and in love with him, did I miss something?Anyway, once again loved the story, would like to see more of the character Shanda, she brings humor to the book.  I'm just starting Atonement, can't wait to see what Alfonso is going to do when he finds out, hope he leaves her for good.  Anyway, love the character of Alfonso strong but tortured.  Would have been 5 star but I had to give 4 because there was no lead up to what happen with Selange, it kind of just happen so it didn't make any sense in the book.",4,1

3251319,Delightful!,"I just finished this book for a new book group this week. It's sponsored by my food co-op and it meets at Ed's No Name bar, so those were good omens! The book was well worth the time to read, even if the book group doesn't pan out. Essays are organized around the central role that food plays in the author's life and each essay is followed by a recipe (I bookmarked many!).  The writing is warm and friendly. The author seems like a person I'd love to have for a friend. She takes us through childhood, the death of her father, and meeting her husband in an inviting voice, while treating us to delicious-sounding descriptions of the food in the story of her life. Highly recommended for foodies.",5,1

4280373,Sweet and cuddly ~~ werewolves!,"This is another novel in the growing sub-genre of Humans with animalistic mating urges.Two men with an uncontrollable urge to mate, forced together by werewolf nature.  This story's real twist is the tenderness drawing the reader into their love scenes.  An emotional connection, unusual to come by.A reversal of a couple of stereo-types makes this novel stand out from the herd. I don't want to throw in spoilers, you'll have to read the book.The universe this novel presents states there is no such thing as female werewolves, which is a shame. There is also a little bit of repetitiveness, but I think it's just the author making us wait for it. (Wait for it ...)The endearment of this story is we have ""two"" climatic consummation scenes, by it's very definition.Happy reading!",5,1

5736486,Outstanding,"I pretty much agree 100% with the first review, except maybe I'm not sharp enough to detect any lack of recording quality.I was too busy being enthralled with the music itself. Tracks 1 & 3 are my favorites.As an aside, I am a huge Mozart fan; I have the whole collected works on Brilliant Classics, and love it. This recording is better than the one on Brilliant Classics.For my copy of this, I downloaded it from iTunes. If I were to do it again, I would buy the CD from Amazon. I miss being able to read the jacket, and having a reliable back-up copy for my money.Bottom Line: If you like classical music, and you like choral music, go for this. It isn't too churchy, like Bach can be sometimes.As others said, Ave Verum Corpus is good, but there are many many recordings of this, and not many at all of the Vespers.",5,1
8290863,Absolutely bananas!,"I read this book to my younger brother and he absolutely loved it, it's already his favorite bedtime story and he's already make me read it again over to him twice now.. That's saying A LOT because my brother has to be one of the most critical and pickiest children in the world, there aren't many things he likes - and especially not stories, but somehow the author has managed to create a book that even appeals to him.Love the book, he found it very entertaining and he enjoyed all the illustrations, too. I'll probably be checking out the others soon, he's already trying to convince me!",5,1
634298,Beautifully haunting book!,"I first read this book as a senior in high school and I absolutely adored it. I think one of the most amazing things about this novel is that the characters aren't exactly likable and yet you love them anyway. I love Heathcliff, though admittedly I wouldn't ever want to date him. I think Heathcliff is one of my favorite likable bad guys in literature along with Severus Snape. I would really recommend this book to anyone looking for a love story that transcends time and life. One of my favorite things about this book is that it's not just some simple love story where the guy falls in love with the girl and then something bad happens that threatens the relationship but it all works out in the end. I think it is even more tragic than Romeo and Juliet and definitely more complicated. Anyway, I highly recommend reading this book.",5,1

7447849,Upgraded,"I purchased the first Roku sometime in 2007 or 2008 and shortly after cancelled my cable TV service. We have been using it daily since then, mainly for Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney (the classic cartoons are my favorite). This Roku 3 absolutely blows the old one away. You can navigate menus, search screens much faster and the movies load 100x faster. I always thought that my router might be bogged down a bit when the old one took some time to load a movie, but it turns out that the original Roku was just a little slow. Doesn't matter though, this third unit is incredible. Big fan of Roku, buy it. You will have to register this unit as you did the original one, so there is like 10 minutes of data entry set up time but thats all.",5,1
1643903,Well done!,"I was suspicious when I first purchased this book, and thought to myself ""it will be very difficult to write a convincing sequal to Dracula.""  But let's just say I was pleasantly surprised.  Bergstrom takes the character of Mina and gives her a dark side.  The architypal heroine in distress is pulled from the pages of Dracula and becomes a complex, enigmatic, scheming, and sensual woman.  There are creepy moments, and the sex is pretty volcanic.  The plot moves well, as is elegantly constructed.  My only complaint is that the ending seemed a little overdone, almost too complicated.Nevertheless, if you like Gothic horror, you will love this book.",4,1
3101058,Great book,"Exciting, thrilling, full of action and the ""other worldly""!  The story line was very relevant and the fast paced action packed investigation was riveting.  The characters were a bonus as each personality was revealed.  Best book in this genre I have read!",5,1

I haven't even jumped on the so-called smart phone train.

Excellent remote and you will never need another one!",5,1
910125,Love and the Heart and Mind,"A superb compilation of well-documented research on the dynamics of love and loss. However the book  may appear to be of more interest to academics, anthropologists, social scientists, and psychlogists than to the mass market. But a worthwile read for those interested in the consequences of love/rejection/abandonment/recovery.Nonetheless, for those who are suffering from the inability to find closure at the end of rejecting  relationships, it may be helpful (once you overcome the academic jargon,) to comprehend the neurological chemistry of broken relationships suggesting,via studies of the brain, that that the elongated recovery from rejection and unrequited love correlates to chemical addictions such as cocaine.In light of this:Look online for the  paper published by Fisher,et.al (2010) Department of Psychology, State University of New York, Stony Brook ""Reward Addition, and Regulation Emotional Systems Associated with Rejection in love""Very insightful and informative.",4,1

4364263,"Well, it depends on how one views God.","I agree with others. This is a book readers cannot put down. It is fast-paced and presented in a highly readable fashion. This book is definitely plot-driven rather than character driven. Having said that, the entire premise rests on a belief system that sees the events of 9/11 as a judgment of United States and the so-called ""Isaiah Effect."" If people believe that the Old Testament is a literal rendering of God's judgment, then it is not so fantastic as one wold think. I'm just not certain that OT is meant to be taken literally because that would somewhat negate Christ's message of love, salvation, and mercy. Depends on how one views the Bible. I'm not a Biblical scholar, but it's hard to think God would punish so many innocent people.",4,1

But the ones I have used have been discontinued and at first this looked to be a very close fit.  It's not.It's not as wide as the MS, and the ALT, CTRL and system keys are all squished together.  The ALT key on the Microsoft keyboard extends to the V and M (left and right) - these only to X and &#60;.  This means you end up pressing space instead of the alt, and all kinds of other issues.  Also the cursor keys are much thinner than appear in the photo, so you end up pressing multiple ones at the same time.In the end I returned it.  You really cannot tell from the photo how awkward this keyboard really is.",2,0
2207714,Still readable after all these years!,"I read this book when I was a teenager, nearly 50 years ago, and just finished re-reading it. It holds up surprisingly well for a half-century-old work of speculative fiction. Sure, the technology is dated, and you have to mentally multiply all dollar figures by a factor of 20, but as social commentary it's still readable and even engrossing. P&K's portrayal of a decaying, corporate-controlled America is well crafted, with vivid descriptions and dialog. Their grasp of economics is spotty, and Pohl's far-leftist sympathies are all too evident (he was a Communist in his younger days) but the narrative moves along briskly, and the characters are vivid and memorable. I hesitate to give this five stars; it's really more like a 4.5 star entry, but why quibble. GLADIATOR AT LAW is among the classics of mid-century SF.",5,1
122455,kids love it + no ads= Mommy loves it,"my 3 1/2 yr and 1 1/2 yr old kids love this.  They find it easy to play with no instruction from me.  There are numerous points on the screen to touch and make something happen with adorable animations for each letter.  Every letter you open it announces the letter and what word it makes, e.g.: &quot;Aa is for Apple&quot;.  You can touch the letter and it will say the letter name.  Touch it again and it gives a phonetic sound of the letter.  Touch the word (apple) and the voice reads the word.  Touch &quot;is for&quot; and it repeats &quot;A is for apple&quot;.  Great for both ages of my kids for learning and reinforcing letters plus early reading skills.  I love it.

I bought the first one for an HTC Flyer, and the second one for an iPad Mini.  They all appear to be of a high quality material and well made.  The cover  clips onto the sides of the tablet and is designed so that all of the ports and connections are accessable.  The case is designed so that the tablet can be propped at a couple of different angles for desktop viewing, or on your lap.  When folded flat, the cover closes very snugly on the tablet.  Apple iPads automatically enter sleep mode when the cover is closed.  There is an elastic strap on the underside of the cover that makes holding the open tablet very secure, and the whole cover when closed results in a well protected tablet with little extra bulk.  This is clearly the best case I have seen for a tablet computer.",5,1

It's not too overly big like some bags as I wanted something thin.  I would like maybe another bag like this with another 1/2-inch of give but it's working perfectly for me.

And even though the book jacket tells you in advance that he actually made it to freedom, you can't get yourself to believe that this person will be able to survive what he is going through before you actually read it at the end of the book.This is one of the best books I have ever read.",5,1

The reason? Because those few chords were very well  chosen. Since then, the band has done many more albums, running the gamut  from excellent to OK. They have improved musically. They have never done  anything quite like this since; MURMUR is the ONLY album which ALL fans can  agree is top-notch. I know, it's paradoxical, isn't it? Well, just enjoy  the music. This is the R.E.M. album I recommend to people who otherwise  cannot stand R.E.M.",5,1
8190651,Third time still a charm for Lone Star Cowboys series!,"This being the third book in the Lone Star Cowboys series author Tori Scott has written yet another winner! I just fell right back into the world of Morris Springs as I read, It carries that same goodness quality, small community, good people, real life vibe. Throughout the story so much happens and in turn the author takes us through all the emotional states good/bad/ugly. This is a story about picking yourself back up when life knocks you down; reaching out for what you want no matter how scared you are to take that leap and to love those in your life with everything your worth. This book will make you laugh, cry, stomp your foot for hard headed cowboys and leave you wanting more. Tori Scott has a special ability to give life to her words and makes you ""feel"" the stories she writes. I absolutely love her books and recommend her with high regard.",5,1

Parent's can feel very comfortable with the themes underscoring all of John's children's books, unusual hero's with unique skills using their brains to overcome adversity, good female roles (although it would be nice if we could see  a new series with with a female in the prime role) and plenty of action to keep you child interested. While a quick, light read for adults or older children, these are still very enjoyable. I did enjoy the three book arc of this series and it was great to visit the Skandians again.",4,1

A simple, good story of life in general.You will like it, just read bit by it, to avoid fatigue.Four stars, because the deduction and revelations about the crimes could be more artful, than dependent on chance factor so much.",4,1

Guy Vieg, who plays the professor, looks like he needs a good hit of Pepto Bismol; Aaron Haff, who tries to generate some life into Walter, merely looks dazed and confused.  The rest of the cast, oh boy....where did they find them?  And notice that in the outdoor scenes, there are no other people or cars around.  The director also likes to segue into action scenes by showing the same silhouetted moon and cars going 160 miles on the freeway.  A lame excuse for a horror movie that doesn't quite make cult cheez status.",1,0

I guess that those ten or so grammy awards for his last album went to his head.  The only reason I give this album two stars instead of one is that Carlos is a great musician and great guitarist and he had an amazing performance at woodstock.  But, this is total [baloney]!  Why does he feel that he has to bring in these other artists who can only hurt his music?  Supernatural was good because he chose other musicians thoughtfully, but Placido Domingo and P.O.D. on the same CD?  Come on!  Carlos needs to go back to writing good music with his own band instead of doing a bunch of collaborations with artists that don't deserve to collaborate with him.  There is no need to make another Supernatural.  And there is no need for Santana to become pop.  I know Carlos could do better than this with his own band.  So avoid this one.",2,0

6851944,Great solution,"I looked at I don't know how many camera back packs, carry bags, rolling bags, all kinds of bags.  Based on the reviews I opted for this one.  I couldn't be happier.  Very nice quality bag and well constructed.  Zippers work buttery smooth and the bag seems well padded.  Comfortable to carry and with the chest and waist straps it takes a lot of the weight off the shoulders.  The shoulder straps are nicely padded as well.  The inside swallows a lot of gear.  If your a pro carrying a zillion lenses and speed lights, you will probably not be able to pack it all in, so, buy two. :-)  At 30 bucks a pop I don't think you can beat it.  The inside is configured so you can carry your camera body with a lens attached (long or short) and the velcro partitions can be reconfigured to pack in different size gear.  One caution though, the back is not terribly deep so long lenses will need to go in lying down.",5,1

1770266,Another medieval who-done-it,"I thought I had tired of Cadfael, but the book suddenly sat there on a shelf - the only new book that seemed to call my name, so I tried, and she did it again. The storyline is close to the rest of the books in the  series, a combination of a mystey and a lovestorey. This time with a  surprising conclusion. Resume: there is (as usual) a fair near the convent,  pilgrims come to the fair because the saint (from Morbid taste for bones)is  beeing moved to her permanet resting place. Among the pilgrims a pair of  men travelling together, one a pilgrim the other his companion and a small  family consisting of brother, sister and aunt. These five plus Cadfael are  the main charecters.  We get a miracle, some political intrigue, a small  love story and a murder all in a readable prose. It is well worth the time  and money.",4,1

Granada is the home of the Sultana.  She is married off at the age of 9 to the nephew of her grandfather by tradition, but against her will.  It is an interesting and fast paced novel with treason and murder and constantly changing alliances during this time of civil war.

Its got dance songs, ballads, passionate songs a little bit of it all and I reccommend it to anyone who likes Mary but dont own it.

3096614,How Modern Vegas Came to Exist,"As with others who have posted reviews, I first learned about Jay Sarno from Super Casino, and have always wondered why such an important figure in the history of Las Vegas has received so little attention. I was excited to see that David G. Schwartz had given this epic figure the attention he deserves, and was not disappointed by the result. The highlight is definitely the excitement leading up to the opening of Caesars Palace, the story of a visionary figure building something entirely new, original, and personal. This book is recommended for anybody who wants to learn about how modern Vegas came to be.",4,1

""California Dreamin'"" is absolutely beautiful, one of the greatest pop songs of all time, and I have never heard anyone speak of it other than in glowing terms.  ""Monday, Monday,"" ""Dedicated to the One I Love,"" and ""Dream a Little Dream of Me"" are instantly recognizable classics, but I prefer ""Twelve-Thirty,"" with its gorgeous chorus.  ""Creeque Alley"" is one of the most fun songs I know, aside from being an ""autobiography.""  For concise selection of the best songs of The Mamas & the Papas, this CD is just about perfect.",4,1

5834266,Nice Collection!,"Ok, I bought this DVD a couple of months ago, and I just wanted to clarify some things.Pros: The video and audio quality is awesome. The Videos Included are Awesome, And the Extra features are quite entertaining, especially the Liberty EPK. The DVD box is nice too.Cons: Some great videos are missing. For Example, Breath After Breath, Femme Fatale, Perfect Day, Too Much Information, Out Of My Mind and White Lines. It would've been great and very apropiate to include the Greatest EPK from 1998. Some live versions doesn't hurt anyone also. And finally, there should be comments about the reunion, the DVD and the videos from the band.Well, anyway, this collection is still great, includes all the classics from the 80's and 90's with some exceptions. But if you want to see it from another point of view, Emi will probably never release another video collection DVD from this band including all the missing videos. So I recommend you to buy this DVD if you like this band or if you want a bit of nostalgia.",4,1

2567495,A most entertaining read about a young man's mid-century travels in Europe,"Anything by Gore Vidal is worth reading. This account of a young man's year in Europe is filled with exotic characters, some verging on the ridiculous and others more sinister in their intentions. The narrator's love affairs with two different women are not totally convincing as most of his associates appear to be gay. He observes closely the absurd behavior of several men locked into a strange cult of worshiping a hermaphrodite who appears to be wanted by the police. For some weird and way out experiences Gore Vidal is a master story-teller and keeps you turning the pages. Highly recommended.",5,1

5747320,"Nice set, though strangely arranged","Released in 1992, this has themes from each of the Bonds up thru 1989's License To Kill.  (So nothing from any of the Pierce Brosnan films.)  What's great about this collection is its completeness.  They find space to include a couple of the fine John Barry instrumentals: the wonderful theme from On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and a characteristic theme from From Russia With Love which you'll recognize the second you hear it.  (Frankly I might buy this disk for the On Her Majesty's Secret Service theme alone.)  There's also a Dionne Warwick song from Thunderball, which previously had not appeared on CD.What's weird about this collection is that the tracks are not in chronological order.  Jarring.  For my own use I take these tracks and re-burn them onto a CD in chrono order.  I don't understand what the producers were thinking when they set the track order of this collection.But it's a good to have these tracks.  It's a nice set.",4,1
998952,a translation of scientific history for the rest of us,"In this book, travel writer Bill Bryson takes us on his greatest journey yet, a trip into science, through our galaxy, into our earth, and deep into our species.  Based on three years of research and interviews, Bryson summarizes the basics of almost all scientific fields - from chemistry to biology to astronomy, genetics, paleontology, zoology and geology.  The book is full of interesting facts and provides a nice summary of all those things that many people probably forgot after high school.For those who enjoy books on tape, this is an especially nice book to listen to.

8081310,Who can u really TRUST?,"This is the 1st story that I read from the ""Dynamic Duo"", Fire & Ice. These two awesome writers draw you in from the very beginning and they don't let you down. This short tells the story of Stacy & Jamier's world wind romance. How things can go from good to bad in 0-60 seconds. I thought that Stacy was a little naive and really wasn't feeling her in the beginning but she put on her big girl panties when she needed to and handled her business. I am definitely a fan of the Dynamic Duo and I will continue to support their work. Big Ups Ladies! Keep doing your thing.",5,1
3801670,Second chance at Love!,"This was a cute romance of high school sweethearts who rekindle their relationship. It was a rocky road as Julia tries to figure out what she wants in her life.

At times I wanted to smack Julia and say what the hell but I did understand where she was coming from.I can't wait to see what's going on with Julia's little brother, Adam and her best friend Carly. That sounds like a great follow up book.",4,1

9088566,"""Willing And Able"".","Video collections are usually a bit less exciting to an extent somewhat may be because often one has seen some/most of the videos beforehand. I decided to buy this DVD because of the promised interviews of band members by Prince as extras, but these inserts of interviews of the NPG members answering the question from Prince ""Why do u like 2 play in this band/NPG?"", are just ordinary, nothing spectacular! The videos (8) plus live concert footage (4) do compensate for my disappointment with the interviews somewhat though. I had not heard or seen ""Call The Law"" before, it was something new. Live performance footage shows how great ""His Purple Highness"" is in live shows! Great release, better extras would have been welcome & where are ""Daddy Pop"" & ""Walk Don't Walk""? Prince is ""Willing And Able"" to deliver the goods, but not enough in this one to deserve more than four stars!",4,1

Both my daughter and I felt that the scenes at the North Pole with the toy Santa were over the top and rather disappointing.  More time spent with the real Santa and his hunt for a Mrs. Clause would have given this tale the depth and touch of seriousness that made the first one such a success.

The author devotes 300 pages to the protaganist's quest to feel ""real"" by wasting a fortune ""reenacting"" a series of events.  We never find out what's wrong with this guy - is it brain damage from his trauamtic injury or is he just a self-absorbed creep who now has the money to indulge himself? His obsession culminates in several deaths, which appear not to bother him in the least.  I get the feeling the author wrote this book just because he could, not because he had anything to say.

Don't get me wrong, this guy has got a great voice it's just the endless and meaningless vocal accrobatics that really get on my nerves. He sounds almost hysterical at times and it is the stopping that he has trouble with.  Just when the forward button comes into reach , the band rescues the show with another sublime burst of pure ROCKING BLUES, wailing guitars and driving rythms. This is my second WHEELIES CD and both have a permanent place on the playing roster despite the singer. My wife screams for me to get it off the system as the singer goes into another hysterical outburst of WHOOOAAASS and WHOOOOPS.

Also, the heater, which is one of the cheapest, easiest things to design, isn't effective.  The manual says not to use it when the temperature is below 45 degrees, probably because that's the point at which heat would leave the room faster than this thing can manage to crank it out.

He has been investigated by IA and is being charged with stealing drugs from a previous drug bust. Both characters are really down on their luck.  The twists and turns keep you going in this story that seems to have several separate stories, but somehow intertwine. Well written, well defined characters that are very likeable. And best of all, it takes place in Seattle mostly.  I live across the Sound from there.  Great book, hopefully the beginning of a new series, characters are worth visiting again and again.

Take his analysis of ""Dumb and Dumber"": unchanging characters that work only in a comedy where even if the narrative isn't coherent, does the story achieve its intended effect? Absolutely. The book covers story typology, character origins and growth, and all components all writers should absorb along the way, right down to fear.

Sentimental...yes. But who doesn't love the sweet  pleasure of sentimentality at holiday time? An easy afternoon read, about  one-third the length of a regular Hamish mystery.

Trent, a former golf-pro who has come home to help with the family business, actually wants to help her.I truly loved this story. Hilarious story and makes me want to move there to hang out with the group of women who form Darcy's circle of friends.",5,1

6802743,A Great Starter Table,"I decided to start listening to vinyl at home recently and wanted a decent turntable for under $100. I'm running it into an entry level Onkyo 5.1 surround system. I've only used a few others in the past to compare it to but I'm certainly impressed with this one, especially for the price.It was easy to assemble but make sure you follow the instuctions on connecting the belt to the drive. The automatic controls are very easy to use and function exactly as they should. Cable adapters are provided for different connection needs which is a bonus. It also just has a sleek and classy look to it.I only went with the USB version of this table because it was just a few more dollars and I might use it one day. I have not connected it to a computer yet though so I can't comment on that functionality.I'd like to add a tube preamp and an upgraded stylus at some point but overall, I think this is a great table to get the casual listener started with records.",5,1

8735992,The Best Roger Moore Bond Film.,"This is one of the more &#34;comic-booky&#34; Bonds but also one of the best. Bond and Russian Agent XXX team up to find out who is tracking and capturing Allied and Russian nuclear submarines. The main villain is one who is not interested in money or ransom which was fairly unique for Bond in 1977. This movie sees the introduction of probably the most famous henchman- Jaws- who is played as an intimidating monster vs. comedic buffoon in &#34;Moonraker.&#34; It also introduces Gogol the Russian equivalent of M who would appear in 5 more Bond movies. Egypt is a good location for much of the film and the ski chase in Austria in the beginning (which actually has consequences later in the film) is a great sequence. Moore was in 3 good Bond films: Live and Let Die, Spy Who Loved Me, and For Your Eyes Only. You can safely skip the other 4. I think even people who aren't fans of Bond would like this.",5,1

8845532,Vulgar does not equal funny,"Well, I will admit that I am a big Jim Carrey fan. I will also admit that this movie was not very good. There are some funny parts that are quite vulgar, but overall the movie is a complete waste of time.Jim Carrey tries to find humor in being obscene (yes, obscene even for him), but many of the sick jokes fall flat. There is almost no plot at all (not that I really expected any). This movie could have been about 15 minutes, not 90. For some reason people often find profanity funny; I think that this is often an overseen mistake with many comedy script writers. Not funny.  Don't bother with this one. ...",1,0

7527721,A Great Value,"I am very happy with this cordless vacuum.  I had previously purchased the Hoover Linx (approx $150) - which I loved.  However, the Linx roller stopped working within a year.  I purchased a second Linx - which also had had a problem with the roller.  So, I began looking for a much cheaper vacuum that would work, but be much cheaper to replace when needed.  The Eureka does not pick up as well as the Linx (which picked up as quickly as a standard vacuum), but it does pick up most items on a single swipe.  Heavier items may need 3 or 4 swipes with a change of direction.  I've had the Eureka for several months and it is working well.  All things considered, this is a much better value than the Hoover Linx.",5,1

2382064,Sexy Sci-Fi Action with Intrigue and Comic Book Type Action,"I really liked the cover art, so I bought this book on a whim, and could not put it down.It's about this strong chick that falls into working with a sorta MIB (Men in Black) organization.  This hot MIB guy zeros in on her and in between killing nasty alien parasites, there's lots of funny sometimes campy sexy action.  For example, the main character, Kitty, listens to her i-pod and uses weapons like hairspray from her purse when she's fighting giant comic book-type killer aliens.This book is a romp of entertainment.  It's NOT for minors - there are three explicit sex scenes which are intrensic to the plot, (and are a lot of fun for the reader).  One of the scenes has elements on non-con.  If you like action, sci-fi, Men in Black (MIB), with some fun romance thrown in, this book is for you.The only downfall is the bittersweet agony of waiting until the author publishes the next Kitty Book.",5,1
1370123,New to Romance Genre,"I'm new to the Romance genre but do love Historical fiction. I did thoroughly enjoy this book even after having read all the reviews first.  I do agree though, some aspects of the book can get frustrating but perhaps that was the author's intent. The lack of communication between the two main characthers makes you want to scream in parts but finally it is resolved (as you'd expect)in the climax. I still found I was intrigued by the story and characters nonetheless and have to agree I did find some parts of the book a bit of a tear jearker. :)",4,1

655064,Loved it!,"I enjoyed the plot of this one. It grabbed my attention from the first page and I couldn't put it down. The heroine grows more in this book. She becomes stronger emotionally and her confidence grows. By the end of the book I felt she was strongly coming into her own and this makes her an even more likable character. Vlad aso grows in different ways and we were given a closer look into his way of thinking. The way they both grew and adjusted to thier situation, facing up to certain problems, made thier relationship feel stronger and more connected for me. They are truly great together. It is somewhat darker than the first book but in a way that it does not become overwhelming. Along with the action and a few comical parts this book swept me into the story. I love when a book is good enough that you forget that your just reading because your so lost in the story. Another amazing book from Jeaniene Frost. Can't wait to read the next one!",5,1

3623712,Good read.,"I wasn't sure at first but I did like this book. I thought the heroine was very depressed but who wouldn't be? I even bought the 2nd and 3rd book. I grew to dislike the heroines inability to control her space even when her power was growing by the day.Her dislike for sluts when she just took 3-4 books to become one was a tad bit off butting but o' well! I found it funny that it was ok for this powerful woman to be so fast and so deadly and yet she could not keep a guy from grabbing and grinding on her when it suited her. The concept was original  however and I made it to the 3rd book. The author lost me with the dragons, gods, sex with gods etc. I've decided to try her Demon series and can only hope the sex with every Tom, Dick and Harry, dragon, god and vampire takes place in the 3rd or 4th book. Good read until then!",4,1

After 4 decades of watching horror movies I didn't think there was anything out there that could scare me anymore. Boy was I wrong! This movie is Freaky, suspensful, and downright scary in the tradition of the ""Entity"", which coinsidentialy also starred Barbara Hershey, mixed in with a bit of poltergeist.I recommend this movie to anyone seeking a good scare and chills.

Just like Maddy, Alison Sweeney is full of energy in Scared Scriptless. Maddy is your average girl with dreams of one day seeing a TV show showcasing her name as executive producer. Love never crossed her mind until Craig and Adam start paying attention to her. She has no time for romance yet something about these two is making her lose her sanity. Saving a town and finding out who really loves her for who she is definitely taking a toll on her. One has ulterior motives and the other is just too normal for her even though he is Hollywood&#8217;s hottest actor right now.

Her card scene with POns is electrifying. Small roles are all  movingly done and there are many of them in Puccini's most ambitous score.  Newcomers to this work will need patience but they will be well rewarded.  Probably not mmore difficult than &quot;Turandot&quot; but  &quot;Fanciulla&quot; doesn't have a &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; or  &quot;Questa reggia&quot; but in these hands it is thrilling.

I ordered the book and to my surprise it was written as a novel.  This meant that I had to wade through a whole lot of 'new writer' prose to get back to the information I wanted to hear.  Because the information as so good, and Mr. Lemriel was such a good speaker, I am giving the book more slack than I normally would.While I never believe 100% of anything I read, even when I'm writing, The Seres Agenda had the ring of truth to many parts of it.  There are beings on other dimensions who feed off our negative emotions, and considering the state of negative that our world seems to be in, they must be having the same obesity problems we're having.I hope the next book Mr. Lemriel writes is non-fiction then he won't to apologize for anything.",4,1

It doesn't really introduce the bands with any introspective and in my opinion, the covers, supposedly the one thing that holds this album together, are bland.  The latest tracks from Alkaline Trio(While You're Waiting and Queen of Pain) are probably the only reason I would purchase this c.d. knowing its content beforehand.  Rooftops as performed by Alkaline Trio is wonderful, but I have a strong bias, and I don't like Hot Water Music much.  Allthough, their rendition of Alk. Trio's Radio is different, and might protect this c.d. from being another bland Jade Tree recording.  So basically, this album is wonderful for the fan of both bands, who willingly spend money to be completists.",4,1

Axl suspects Victor Matland who is an art dealer, but a drug delaer too (even though no one knows) when Axl questions him he gets thrown out. then he goes to Victor's warehouse where he finds Cocaine and gets chased away. He goes to victor's house with two cops (I forgot there names) and they shoot the guards and Axl ends up shooting Victor who had kidnapped the woman, then it ends.Overall this is a good movie for a laugh and is just goodand thats all I have to say about that",5,1

1299503,One of the best,"The beginning of this novel isn't super great but once the tournament gets into play, its absolutely amazing.  The ending is amazing and worth every cent.  Among the best fight scenes ever without losing the series' humor and strong storyline.",5,1

6501693,Very good! and very pricey!,"If you're a pro, i don't think i can tell you much about it other than you can put two batteries instead of one or add alkalines for survival and have a better grip.If you're an amateur just like me, you won't look like one after buying this grip, and the tinny XT will be monster XT instead of rebel anymore.Works perfectly, gives you a better grip and makes you camero more weighty.If you can afford it, do it! you won't regret. but i can't see a reason for the price, even when satisfied with it.",5,1

2132601,Breaking the Nexus,"I love stories where fantasy and reality collide. In this novel, the collision is quite literal. The Nexus, a barrier between the human realm and one where the creatures of myth are reality, is being torn down. Connor, a detective in Denver, has no reason to believe in anything but facts until Sha literally drops into one of his crime scenes. Things quickly go to hell as the barrier between realms is torn and creatures begin terrorizing Denver. It will be interesting to see how their relationship progresses as the Nexus collapses.",4,1

5784995,intense,Transfigured Night is a high Romantic piece that shows the beautiful side of Schoenberg before he went completely atonal with his 12 tone system.  The Karajan/Berlin performance is both beautiful and very intense.  Great recording.,5,1
8622988,One of my favorite movies ever!,"Got this for my sister for Christmas. . .I couldn't believe she had never seen it before!  This movie really takes me back to the 70s, although I was barely old enough at the time to catch a glimpse of the era, myself.  The star-studded cast is in the early prime of their careers. . .the acting is superb. . .and the story is a great adventure!  Must see!!!",5,1
4845744,Ew!,"What would you do if you contracted a disease that makes your skin literally peel off? This book is as terrifying as it is gross and I loved every minute of it.Be forewarned that it is a novella and shorter than other works by this author but at less than a buck, it is totally worth it!",5,1
1428581,One-of-a-kind,"What I love most about a Toni Morrison novel is that you know not to expect anything typical or tidy or even morally satisfying. You're going to get something real and gritty, laced with pain and complication. I read Sula three times, and each time I took more from it. The story is dark, but the read is beautiful with its poetic prose and magical realism. This novel demands you open your mind or you'll miss the power of her storytelling. Sula is the kind of character you'd probably dislike if another writer told her story, but Toni Morrison has a way of setting aside narrow definitions of good and evil and presenting pure, take-it-for-what-it-is humanity. Her wisdom reaches so far outside the box, when I read her work, I almost forget about the box altogether, and briefly experience the view from this one-of-a-kind, brilliant mind.",5,1

4428375,An insightul read on the evil of power wielded by the wealthy.,"This historical novel reminds us, yet again, how money corrupts and power corrupts absolutely.  It also reminds us that try as we might, mankind is not able to improve himself by himself.  The folly of humanism is revealed in knowing that man, thinking all would be corrected by education, science and philosophy, has simply consolidated power on a larger scale.This is a very worthwhile read if only to help you understand why our country is in the mess it is today.",4,1
4794878,Really enjoyed this,This was a fast paced RS. Easy to get into and a smooth writing style. This was an easy read that kept my attention. The creepier the killer the better. I really liked the dominating US Marshal Vassar and the know it all Wynne who used to be a bill collector. These two are so steamy together.,4,1
3668714,A Little Hair of the Dog,"When I first started reading this book my first thought was it wasn't my kind of book. Was I wrong, it made me laugh through basically the whole story, except for a couple of pages where it was serious. I loved all the characters that she created in this story. Ann, Kell, Kyle and of course Henry the Great Dane were my favorite ones. I would recommend it to everyone, even if your beliefs have nothing to do with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it wouldn't matter at all because personally I don't, but I loved the story. Great Book!",5,1
